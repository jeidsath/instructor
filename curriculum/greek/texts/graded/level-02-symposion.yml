content: |
  ὁ δεσπότης τοὺς φίλους εἰς τὸ συμπόσιον ἐκάλεσεν.
  οἱ δοῦλοι οἶνον καὶ σῖτον παρεσκεύασαν.
  οἱ φίλοι ἐν τῷ ἀνδρῶνι κατεκλίθησαν.
  πρῶτον μὲν ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον· ἔπειτα δὲ διελέγοντο.
  εἷς τῶν φίλων ἐρώτησεν· "τί ἐστιν ἀρετή;"
  ἄλλος ἀπεκρίνατο· "ἡ ἀρετή ἐστιν τὸ εὖ πράττειν."
  τρίτος δὲ εἶπεν· "ἡ σοφία ἐστὶν ἡ μεγίστη ἀρετή."
  πολὺν χρόνον διελέχθησαν. νυκτὸς τέλος οἱ φίλοι ἀπῆλθον.

  The master invited his friends to the drinking party.
  The slaves prepared wine and food.
  The friends reclined in the men's hall.
  First they ate and drank; then they conversed.
  One of the friends asked: "What is virtue?"
  Another answered: "Virtue is to act well."
  A third said: "Wisdom is the greatest virtue."
  For a long time they discussed. At night the friends finally departed.
