  Περικλῆς, ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων στρατηγός, ἐπιτάφιον λόγον ἔλεξεν
  ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ ἀποθανόντων.
  "ἡ πολιτεία ἡμῶν," εἶπεν, "δημοκρατία καλεῖται, ὅτι ὑπὸ τῶν πολλῶν
  ἀλλ᾿ οὐχ ὑπὸ τῶν ὀλίγων διοικεῖται.
  φιλοκαλοῦμεν μετ᾿ εὐτελείας καὶ φιλοσοφοῦμεν ἄνευ μαλακίας.
  τὴν πόλιν τῆς Ἑλλάδος παίδευσιν εἶναι φημί."
  οὗτος ὁ λόγος τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐθάρρυνεν.
  οἱ γὰρ ἀκούσαντες ἐνόμισαν τοὺς ἀποθανόντας οὐ μάτην ἀποθανεῖν.
translation: |
  Pericles, the general of the Athenians, delivered a funeral speech
  on behalf of those who had died in the war.
  "Our constitution," he said, "is called a democracy, because it is administered
  by the many and not by the few.
  We love beauty with economy and pursue wisdom without softness.
  I say that our city is the education of Greece."
  This speech encouraged the Athenians.
  For those who heard it considered that the dead had not died in vain.
