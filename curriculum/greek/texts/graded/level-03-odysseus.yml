content: |
  Ὀδυσσεὺς μετὰ τῶν ἑταίρων εἰς τὴν νῆσον ἀφίκετο.
  σπήλαιον μέγα εὗρον ἐν ᾧ τυρὸς καὶ γάλα ἦν.
  ὁ Κύκλωψ, ὃς Πολύφημος ἐκαλεῖτο, εἰσῆλθεν. λίθον μέγαν πρὸ τῆς θύρας ἔθηκεν.
  δύο τῶν ἑταίρων λαβὼν κατέφαγεν. Ὀδυσσεὺς μηχανὴν ἐπενόησεν.
  οἶνον τῷ Κύκλωπι ἔδωκεν. ὁ Κύκλωψ πολὺν οἶνον πιὼν ἐκοιμήθη.
  Ὀδυσσεὺς ξύλον πυρώσας τὸν ὀφθαλμὸν αὐτοῦ ἐτύφλωσεν.
  ὁ Κύκλωψ ἐβόησεν· "τίς σε ἐτύφλωσεν;" Ὀδυσσεὺς ἀπεκρίνατο· "Οὖτις."
  ὑπὸ τοῖς προβάτοις κρυφθέντες οἱ Ἕλληνες ἐξέφυγον.
translation: |
  Odysseus arrived at the island with his companions.
  They found a great cave in which there was cheese and milk.
  The Cyclops, who was called Polyphemus, entered. He placed a great stone before the door.
  Having seized two of the companions, he devoured them. Odysseus devised a plan.
  He gave wine to the Cyclops. The Cyclops, having drunk much wine, fell asleep.
  Odysseus, having heated a stake, blinded his eye.
  The Cyclops cried out: "Who blinded you?" Odysseus answered: "Nobody."
  Hidden under the sheep, the Greeks escaped.
