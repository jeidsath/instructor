title: "Προμηθεὺς καὶ τὸ Πῦρ"
difficulty: 5
content: |
  ὁ Ζεὺς τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τὸ πῦρ οὐκ ἔδωκεν. ἄνευ πυρὸς οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἐν σκότῳ ᾤκουν.
  Προμηθεὺς δὲ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἐλεήσας τὸ πῦρ ἐκ τοῦ Ὀλύμπου ἔκλεψεν.
  τὸ πῦρ ἐν νάρθηκι κρύψας πρὸς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἤνεγκεν.
  οἱ ἄνθρωποι, τὸ πῦρ λαβόντες, τέχνας πολλὰς ἔμαθον.
  ὁ Ζεὺς ὀργισθεὶς τὸν Προμηθέα ἐκόλασεν. πρὸς τῷ Καυκάσῳ δεθεὶς
  ὑπ᾿ ἀετοῦ τὸ ἧπαρ ἐσθιόμενος ἔπασχεν.
  πολλοῖς ἔτεσιν ὕστερον Ἡρακλῆς αὐτὸν ἔλυσεν.
translation: |
  Zeus did not give fire to humans. Without fire, humans lived in darkness.
  But Prometheus, pitying the humans, stole fire from Olympus.
  Having hidden the fire in a fennel stalk, he brought it to humans.
  The humans, having received the fire, learned many arts.
  Zeus, angered, punished Prometheus. Bound to the Caucasus,
  he suffered having his liver eaten by an eagle.
  Many years later Heracles freed him.
