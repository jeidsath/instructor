content: |
  Σωκράτης ἐν ταῖς Ἀθήναις ᾤκει. οὐκ ἦν πλούσιος ἀλλὰ σοφός.
  ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ τοὺς νεανίας ἐδίδασκεν. ἠρώτα αὐτούς· "τί ἐστιν τὸ ἀγαθόν;"
  οἱ νεανίαι ἀπεκρίναντο, ἀλλ᾿ ὁ Σωκράτης ἀεὶ ἄλλας ἐρωτήσεις ἠρώτα.
  ἔλεγεν· "ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα."
  τινὲς τῶν πολιτῶν τὸν Σωκράτη ἐμίσουν. ἐγράψαντο αὐτὸν ἀσεβείας.
  οἱ δικασταὶ αὐτὸν θανάτου κατεδίκασαν.
  ὁ Σωκράτης τὸ φάρμακον ἔπιεν καὶ ἀπέθανεν. ἡ δόξα αὐτοῦ εἰς ἀεὶ μένει.
translation: |
  Socrates lived in Athens. He was not rich but wise.
  In the marketplace he taught the young men. He asked them: "What is the good?"
  The young men answered, but Socrates always asked more questions.
  He said: "One thing I know, that I know nothing."
  Some of the citizens hated Socrates. They charged him with impiety.
  The jurors condemned him to death.
  Socrates drank the poison and died. His fame endures forever.
