  πάντες οἱ Ἕλληνες πρὸς τὴν Ὀλυμπίαν ἀφίκοντο.
  τέτταρα ἔτη μεταξὺ τῶν ἀγώνων ἦν. ἐν τοῖς ἀγῶσιν οἱ ἄριστοι ἠγωνίζοντο.
  ἔδραμον, ἐπάλαισαν, ἐδισκοβόλησαν. οἱ ἵπποι ἐν τῷ ἱπποδρόμῳ ἤλασαν.
  ὁ νικητὴς στέφανον ἐλαίας ἔλαβεν. ἡ πόλις αὐτοῦ μεγάλην τιμὴν εἶχεν.
  ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τῶν ἀγώνων εἰρήνη ἦν. πᾶσαι αἱ πόλεις τοὺς πολέμους ἔπαυσαν.
  οἱ Ἕλληνες τοὺς θεοὺς ἐτίμων καὶ τὴν ἀρετὴν ἐφίλουν.
