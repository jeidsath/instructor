  αἱ Μοῦσαι θυγατέρες τοῦ Διός εἰσιν. ἐν τῷ Ἑλικῶνι κατοικοῦσιν.
  τοῖς ποιηταῖς τὴν τέχνην τῆς μουσικῆς διδάσκουσιν.
  ποιητής τις πρὸς τὸν Ἑλικῶνα ἀνέβη. τὰς Μούσας ᾀδούσας ἤκουσεν.
  αἱ Μοῦσαι αὐτὸν ἰδοῦσαι προσεκάλεσαν. ἡ Καλλιόπη εἶπεν·
  "ὦ ποιητά, ἡμεῖς σοι τὴν ᾠδὴν δώσομεν. σὺ δὲ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους δίδασκε."
  ὁ ποιητής, τὸ δῶρον δεξάμενος, πρὸς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους κατέβη.
  ᾖδεν τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἔργα. πάντες οἱ ἀκούσαντες ἐθαύμασαν.
translation: |
  The Muses are daughters of Zeus. They dwell on Mount Helicon.
  They teach the poets the art of music.
  A certain poet climbed up to Helicon. He heard the Muses singing.
  The Muses, seeing him, called him over. Calliope said:
  "O poet, we will give you the song. But you must teach the people."
  The poet, having received the gift, went down to the people.
  He sang the deeds of the gods. All who heard marveled.
