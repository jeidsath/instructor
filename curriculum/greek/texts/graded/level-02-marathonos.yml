  οἱ Πέρσαι μεγάλῳ στρατῷ εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα ἦλθον.
  ἐν τῷ πεδίῳ τοῦ Μαραθῶνος ἀπέβησαν. οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἐφοβοῦντο·
  ὁ γὰρ στρατὸς τῶν Περσῶν πολὺ μείζων ἦν.
  Μιλτιάδης δὲ ὁ στρατηγὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ἐθάρρυνεν.
  οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι δρόμῳ ἐπὶ τοὺς Πέρσας ἐπέδραμον.
  οἱ Πέρσαι ἐνικήθησαν καὶ πρὸς τὰς ναῦς ἔφυγον.
  ἄγγελος ἀπὸ Μαραθῶνος εἰς τὰς Ἀθήνας ἔδραμεν καὶ τὴν νίκην ἤγγειλεν.
