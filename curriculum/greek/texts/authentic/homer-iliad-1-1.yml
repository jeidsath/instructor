  μῆνιν ἄειδε, θεά, Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος
  οὐλομένην, ἣ μυρί᾿ Ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε᾿ ἔθηκε,
  πολλὰς δ᾿ ἰφθίμους ψυχὰς Ἄϊδι προΐαψεν
  ἡρώων, αὐτοὺς δὲ ἑλώρια τεῦχε κύνεσσιν
  οἰωνοῖσί τε πᾶσι, Διὸς δ᾿ ἐτελείετο βουλή,
  ἐξ οὗ δὴ τὰ πρῶτα διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε
  Ἀτρεΐδης τε ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν καὶ δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς.
translation: |
  Sing, goddess, of the wrath of Peleus's son Achilles,
  the accursed wrath which brought countless sorrows upon the Achaeans,
  and hurled many mighty souls of heroes to Hades,
  and made them themselves prey for dogs
  and all birds, and the plan of Zeus was being fulfilled,
  from the time when first those two stood apart in strife:
  Atreus's son, lord of men, and godlike Achilles.
