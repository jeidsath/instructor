  Δαρείου καὶ Παρυσάτιδος γίγνονται παῖδες δύο, πρεσβύτερος μὲν Ἀρταξέρξης,
  νεώτερος δὲ Κῦρος. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠσθένει Δαρεῖος καὶ ὑπώπτευε τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου,
  ἐβούλετο τὼ παῖδε ἀμφοτέρω παρεῖναι.
  ὁ μὲν οὖν πρεσβύτερος παρὼν ἐτύγχανε· Κῦρον δὲ μεταπέμπεται
  ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἧς αὐτὸν σατράπην ἐποίησε.
  ἀναβαίνει οὖν ὁ Κῦρος λαβὼν Τισσαφέρνην ὡς φίλον,
  καὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἔχων ὁπλίτας ἀνέβη τριακοσίους.
translation: |
  To Darius and Parysatis are born two sons, the elder Artaxerxes,
  the younger Cyrus. When Darius was ill and suspected the end of his life,
  he wished both his sons to be present.
  Now the elder happened to be present; but he sends for Cyrus
  from the province of which he had made him satrap.
  So Cyrus goes up, taking Tissaphernes as a friend,
  and went up with three hundred Greek hoplites.
