  ὅ τι μὲν ὑμεῖς, ὦ ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, πεπόνθατε ὑπὸ τῶν ἐμῶν κατηγόρων,
  οὐκ οἶδα· ἐγὼ δ᾿ οὖν καὶ αὐτὸς ὑπ᾿ αὐτῶν ὀλίγου ἐμαυτοῦ ἐπελαθόμην,
  οὕτω πιθανῶς ἔλεγον. καίτοι ἀληθές γε ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν οὐδὲν εἰρήκασιν.
  μάλιστα δὲ αὐτῶν ἓν ἐθαύμασα τῶν πολλῶν ὧν ἐψεύσαντο,
  τοῦτο ἐν ᾧ ἔλεγον ὡς χρῆ ὑμᾶς εὐλαβεῖσθαι μὴ ὑπ᾿ ἐμοῦ ἐξαπατηθῆτε
  ὡς δεινοῦ ὄντος λέγειν.
translation: |
  What you, men of Athens, have experienced from my accusers,
  I do not know; but I myself was almost made to forget who I am by them,
  so persuasively did they speak. And yet they have said practically nothing true.
  But of the many lies they told, I was most amazed at one in particular,
  when they said that you must beware lest you be deceived by me,
  as though I were a clever speaker.
