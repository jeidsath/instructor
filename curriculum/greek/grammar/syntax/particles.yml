  - name: "Conjunctive Particles"
    subcategory: particles
    difficulty: 2
    prerequisites: []
    description: >
      Greek relies heavily on particles to connect sentences and show logical
      relationships. The most fundamental are καί (and, also, even), ἀλλά
      (but, on the contrary), and the μέν...δέ pairing (on the one hand...on
      the other). Unlike English, Greek prose almost always begins each
      sentence with a connecting particle. The absence of a connective
      (asyndeton) is rhetorically marked.
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ μὲν πατὴρ σοφός ἐστιν, ὁ δὲ υἱὸς ἀμαθής."
        english: "The father is wise, but the son is ignorant."
        notes: "μέν...δέ marks a contrast between two balanced clauses."
      - greek: "ἀλλὰ δεῖ ἡμᾶς μάχεσθαι."
        english: "But we must fight."
        notes: "ἀλλά introduces a strong contrast or correction."

  - name: "Postpositive Particles"
    subcategory: particles
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Conjunctive Particles"]
    description: >
      Many Greek particles are postpositive — they cannot stand first in
      their clause. Key postpositives include γάρ (for, because), οὖν
      (therefore), δή (indeed, in fact), and δέ (but, and). These particles
      typically stand in second position (after the first word or phrase of
      the clause). Understanding their placement is essential for parsing
      Greek sentence structure.
    examples:
      - greek: "οἱ γὰρ Ἀθηναῖοι τὴν ἐλευθερίαν ἐφίλουν."
        english: "For the Athenians loved freedom."
        notes: "γάρ in second position, after the article οἱ. Explains the previous sentence."
      - greek: "δεῖ οὖν ἡμᾶς βουλεύεσθαι."
        english: "Therefore we must deliberate."
        notes: "οὖν is postpositive, drawing an inference from what precedes."

  - name: "Negative Particles"
    subcategory: particles
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Conjunctive Particles"]
    description: >
      Greek has two negatives: οὐ (οὐκ before smooth breathing, οὐχ before
      rough breathing) is the objective negative, used with the indicative
      and in statements of fact. μή is the subjective negative, used with
      the subjunctive, optative, imperative, infinitive, and participle
      (when conditional). Compound negatives (οὐδείς, μηδείς) reinforce
      rather than cancel negation in Greek.
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ ἀνὴρ οὐ σοφός ἐστιν."
        english: "The man is not wise."
        notes: "οὐ negates a factual statement (indicative mood)."
      - greek: "μὴ ποιήσῃς τοῦτο."
        english: "Do not do this."
        notes: "μή with aorist subjunctive for a strong prohibition."

  - name: "Modal Particle ἄν"
    subcategory: particles
    difficulty: 6
    prerequisites: ["Subjunctive Mood", "Optative Mood"]
    description: >
      The particle ἄν (κε/κεν in epic) is the marker of contingency and
      unreality. With the subjunctive in subordinate clauses, it marks
      general or future conditions (ἐάν = εἰ + ἄν). With the optative
      in main clauses, it expresses potential action (λύσειεν ἄν = he
      would/might release). With past indicative, it marks contrary-to-fact
      conditions (εἰ ἔλυσεν ἄν = he would have released). ἄν is never
      used with the present or perfect indicative in main clauses.
    examples:
      - greek: "ἐὰν ἔλθῃ, δεξόμεθα αὐτόν."
        english: "If he comes, we shall receive him."
        notes: "ἐάν (= εἰ + ἄν) + subjunctive in a future more vivid condition."
      - greek: "ταῦτα πράξειεν ἂν ὁ σοφός."
        english: "A wise man would do these things."
        notes: "Potential optative with ἄν expressing possibility."
