      The most straightforward form of indirect discourse uses ὅτι or ὡς
      (that) after verbs of saying and thinking (λέγω, φημί, νομίζω,
      οἴομαι). The original mood and tense are typically retained in the
      subordinate clause. After a secondary (past) main verb, the optative
      may replace the indicative, though retention of the original indicative
      is always possible in Greek (unlike Latin sequence of tenses).
    examples:
      - greek: "λέγει ὅτι ὁ στρατηγὸς ἀπῆλθεν."
        english: "He says that the general departed."
        notes: "ὅτι + indicative retaining original tense (aorist)."
      - greek: "εἶπεν ὅτι ὁ στρατηγὸς ἀπέλθοι."
        english: "He said that the general had departed."
        notes: "After secondary verb εἶπεν, optative (ἀπέλθοι) replaces indicative."

    prerequisites: ["Indirect Discourse with ὅτι/ὡς"]
    description: >
      After verbs of thinking and believing (νομίζω, οἴομαι, φημί, ἡγέομαι),
      Greek uses the accusative + infinitive construction. The subject of the
      infinitive is in the accusative case (unless it is the same as the
      subject of the main verb, in which case it is omitted or in the
      nominative). The tense of the infinitive represents the tense of the
      original statement relative to the main verb.
    examples:
      - greek: "νομίζω τὸν ἄνδρα σοφὸν εἶναι."
        english: "I think that the man is wise."
        notes: "Accusative subject (τὸν ἄνδρα) + infinitive (εἶναι)."
      - greek: "ἔφη αὐτὸς ἰέναι."
        english: "He said that he himself was going."
        notes: "Same subject: nominative implied; αὐτός is emphatic."

  - name: "Indirect Discourse with Participle"
    subcategory: indirect_discourse
    difficulty: 6
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Participle", "Indirect Discourse with ὅτι/ὡς"]
    description: >
      After verbs of knowing, perceiving, and showing (οἶδα, γιγνώσκω,
      ὁράω, ἀκούω, δηλόω), Greek uses the supplementary participle in
      indirect discourse. The participle agrees with the subject or object
      in case, gender, and number. The tense of the participle represents
      the tense of the original action. This construction is distinctive
      to Greek among ancient languages.
    examples:
      - greek: "οἶδα τοῦτον σοφὸν ὄντα."
        english: "I know that this man is wise."
        notes: "Participle (ὄντα) agreeing with accusative object (τοῦτον)."
      - greek: "ᾔσθοντο τοὺς πολεμίους προσιόντας."
        english: "They perceived that the enemies were approaching."
        notes: "Supplementary participle (προσιόντας) with verb of perception."

  - name: "Indirect Questions"
    subcategory: indirect_discourse
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Interrogative and Indefinite Pronouns", "Subjunctive Mood"]
    description: >
      Indirect questions are introduced by interrogative words (τίς, πότε,
      ποῦ, πῶς, πότερον...ἤ) after verbs of asking, knowing, and telling.
      The verb in the indirect question retains the mood of the original
      question in primary sequence. In secondary sequence, the optative
      may replace the indicative or subjunctive. εἰ (whether) introduces
      yes-no indirect questions.
    examples:
      - greek: "ἠρώτησε τίς ταῦτα ἐποίησεν."
        english: "He asked who did these things."
        notes: "Indirect question retaining original indicative after secondary verb."
      - greek: "οὐκ οἶδα πότερον ἀληθῆ λέγεις ἢ ψευδῆ."
        english: "I do not know whether you speak the truth or falsehood."
        notes: "Indirect alternative question with πότερον...ἤ."
