    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 1
    prerequisites: []
    description: >
      The nominative case marks the subject of a finite verb and the predicate
      nominative after linking verbs (εἰμί, γίγνομαι). Greek uses the
      nominative for statements of identity and predication. The vocative
      case is used for direct address, often preceded by ὦ. In many
      declensions the vocative is identical to the nominative (especially
      in the plural, where they are always the same).
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ ἀνὴρ σοφός ἐστιν."
        english: "The man is wise."
        notes: "ἀνήρ is nominative subject; σοφός is predicate nominative."
      - greek: "ὦ Σώκρατες, τί λέγεις;"
        english: "O Socrates, what are you saying?"
        notes: "Σώκρατες is vocative (third-decl. with -ες ending)."

  - name: "Accusative Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 2
    prerequisites: ["Nominative and Vocative Cases"]
    description: >
      The accusative marks the direct object of a transitive verb, the extent
      of space or time, and the object of many prepositions (εἰς, πρός,
      παρά, διά, κατά, ὑπέρ). The accusative of respect (or specification)
      limits the application of an adjective or verb. Cognate accusatives
      repeat the verb's meaning in nominal form.
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ μαθητὴς τὸν λόγον ἔγραψεν."
        english: "The student wrote the speech."
        notes: "τὸν λόγον is the direct object (accusative)."
      - greek: "ἔμεινε τρεῖς ἡμέρας."
        english: "He remained for three days."
        notes: "Accusative of extent of time: τρεῖς ἡμέρας."

  - name: "Genitive Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Accusative Case"]
    description: >
      The genitive is the most versatile Greek case. Core uses include:
      possession (ὁ τοῦ πατρὸς οἶκος), partitive (πολλοὶ τῶν πολιτῶν),
      separation/source (ἀπό, ἐκ + gen.), agent with passive verbs (ὑπό +
      gen.), comparison (σοφώτερος τοῦ ῥήτορος), time within which, and
      objective/subjective genitive. Many prepositions and verbs govern the
      genitive.
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ τοῦ βασιλέως υἱὸς ἀνδρεῖός ἐστιν."
        english: "The king's son is brave."
        notes: "Possessive genitive: τοῦ βασιλέως placed between article and noun."
      - greek: "πολλοὶ τῶν στρατιωτῶν ἀπέθανον."
        english: "Many of the soldiers died."
        notes: "Partitive genitive: τῶν στρατιωτῶν."

  - name: "Dative Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Accusative Case"]
    description: >
      The dative has three main spheres: indirect object (to/for), instrument/
      means (by, with), and location (in, at — especially with ἐν). The
      dative of interest (advantage/disadvantage), dative of possession
      (ἐστί μοι = I have), and dative of agent (with perfect passive) are
      important constructions. The dative also marks the object of many
      verbs (πείθομαι, βοηθέω, ἕπομαι).
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ πατὴρ τῷ παιδὶ δῶρον δίδωσιν."
        english: "The father gives a gift to the child."
        notes: "Indirect object dative: τῷ παιδί."
      - greek: "οἱ στρατιῶται τοῖς ξίφεσι μάχονται."
        english: "The soldiers fight with their swords."
        notes: "Dative of instrument/means: τοῖς ξίφεσι."

  - name: "Dative of Respect and Manner"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Dative Case"]
    description: >
      The dative of respect (or specification) limits the scope of a verb
      or adjective, answering the question 'in what respect?' Common with
      adjectives and verbs of differing: φύσει (by nature), ὀνόματι (in
      name), γένει (by birth). The dative of manner describes how an action
      is performed: σιγῇ (in silence), βίᾳ (by force), σπουδῇ (with haste).
      These uses are essential for reading Greek prose.
    examples:
      - greek: "Ἑλληνικὸς τῷ γένει, Ἀθηναῖος τῇ πολιτείᾳ."
        english: "Greek by birth, Athenian by citizenship."
        notes: "Dative of respect: τῷ γένει and τῇ πολιτείᾳ."
      - greek: "οἱ στρατιῶται σιγῇ ἐπορεύοντο."
        english: "The soldiers marched in silence."
        notes: "Dative of manner: σιγῇ."

  - name: "Genitive Absolute"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 6
    prerequisites: ["Genitive Case", "Present Active Participle"]
    description: >
      The genitive absolute is an adverbial participial phrase in which
      both the participle and its subject stand in the genitive case,
      grammatically independent of the rest of the sentence. It expresses
      time, cause, condition, or concession. The genitive absolute is
      used when the subject of the participle is different from the subject
      of the main verb. It is one of the most characteristic constructions
      in Greek prose.
    examples:
      - greek: "τοῦ ἡλίου ἀνατέλλοντος, οἱ στρατιῶται ἐξῆλθον."
        english: "When the sun was rising, the soldiers went out."
        notes: "Temporal genitive absolute: τοῦ ἡλίου (subject) + ἀνατέλλοντος (participle)."
      - greek: "ταῦτα λεχθέντων, ἡ ἐκκλησία διελύθη."
        english: "When these things had been said, the assembly was dissolved."
        notes: "Genitive absolute with aorist passive participle (neuter plural)."
