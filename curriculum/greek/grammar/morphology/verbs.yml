  - name: "Present Active Indicative"
    subcategory: verb_conjugation
    difficulty: 2
    prerequisites: []
    description: >
      The present active indicative is the most basic Greek verb form, expressing
      ongoing or repeated action in the present. Greek uses thematic (ω) verbs
      as the standard conjugation. Personal endings (-ω, -εις, -ει, -ομεν,
      -ετε, -ουσι) are added to the present stem. The thematic vowel ο/ε
      connects stem and ending.
    paradigm:
      model: "λύω, λύσω, ἔλυσα, λέλυκα, λέλυμαι, ἐλύθην (loose, release)"
      singular: { 1s: "λύω", 2s: "λύεις", 3s: "λύει" }
      plural: { 1p: "λύομεν", 2p: "λύετε", 3p: "λύουσι(ν)" }
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ στρατηγὸς τοὺς αἰχμαλώτους λύει."
        english: "The general releases the prisoners."
        notes: "λύει is 3rd sg. present active indicative of λύω."
      - greek: "οἱ μαθηταὶ τὰ βιβλία γράφουσιν."
        english: "The students write the books."
        notes: "γράφουσιν is 3rd pl.; the movable ν appears before vowels or at sentence end."

    subcategory: verb_conjugation
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Indicative"]
    description: >
      In the present tense, Greek uses one set of endings for both the middle
      voice (subject acts on/for itself) and passive voice (subject is acted
      upon). Context determines which meaning applies. The endings are -ομαι,
      -ῃ/-ει, -εται, -όμεθα, -εσθε, -ονται.
    paradigm:
      model: "λύομαι (I release for myself / I am released)"
      singular: { 1s: "λύομαι", 2s: "λύῃ", 3s: "λύεται" }
      plural: { 1p: "λυόμεθα", 2p: "λύεσθε", 3p: "λύονται" }
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ δοῦλος λύεται."
        english: "The slave is being released."
        notes: "Passive meaning determined by context."
      - greek: "ὁ στρατιώτης τὰ ὅπλα παρασκευάζεται."
        english: "The soldier prepares his weapons (for himself)."
        notes: "Middle voice: the subject acts in his own interest."

  - name: "Imperfect Active Indicative"
    subcategory: verb_conjugation
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Indicative"]
    description: >
      The imperfect expresses continuous or repeated action in the past. It is
      formed by adding an augment (ἐ-) to the present stem, then secondary
      endings (-ον, -ες, -ε, -ομεν, -ετε, -ον). Verbs beginning with vowels
      show temporal augment (lengthening). The imperfect exists only in the
      indicative mood.
    paradigm:
      model: "ἔλυον (I was releasing, I used to release)"
      singular: { 1s: "ἔλυον", 2s: "ἔλυες", 3s: "ἔλυε(ν)" }
      plural: { 1p: "ἐλύομεν", 2p: "ἐλύετε", 3p: "ἔλυον" }
    examples:
      - greek: "οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τοὺς νόμους ἐφύλαττον."
        english: "The Athenians were guarding the laws."
        notes: "ἐφύλαττον: augment ἐ- + stem φυλαττ- + secondary ending -ον."
      - greek: "ὁ διδάσκαλος τοὺς παῖδας ἐδίδασκεν."
        english: "The teacher was teaching the children."
        notes: "Imperfect of διδάσκω with movable ν."

    subcategory: verb_conjugation
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Imperfect Active Indicative", "Present Middle/Passive Indicative"]
    description: >
      The imperfect middle/passive uses the augmented present stem with
      secondary middle endings: -όμην, -ου, -ετο, -όμεθα, -εσθε, -οντο.
      Like the present middle/passive, context determines whether the meaning
      is middle or passive.
    paradigm:
      model: "ἐλυόμην (I was releasing for myself / I was being released)"
      singular: { 1s: "ἐλυόμην", 2s: "ἐλύου", 3s: "ἐλύετο" }
      plural: { 1p: "ἐλυόμεθα", 2p: "ἐλύεσθε", 3p: "ἐλύοντο" }
    examples:
      - greek: "ἡ πόλις ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων ἐπολιορκεῖτο."
        english: "The city was being besieged by the enemies."
        notes: "Imperfect passive of πολιορκέω (contract verb)."
      - greek: "οἱ πολῖται τὰ ὅπλα παρεσκευάζοντο."

  - name: "Future Active Indicative"
    subcategory: verb_conjugation
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Indicative"]
    description: >
      The future active is formed by adding the tense marker -σ- to the verb
      stem, then primary active endings. Labial stems (π, β, φ) + σ = ψ;
      velar stems (κ, γ, χ) + σ = ξ; dental stems (τ, δ, θ) drop the dental
      before σ. Liquid stems (λ, μ, ν, ρ) form a contract future in -ῶ.
    paradigm:
      model: "λύσω (I shall release)"
      singular: { 1s: "λύσω", 2s: "λύσεις", 3s: "λύσει" }
      plural: { 1p: "λύσομεν", 2p: "λύσετε", 3p: "λύσουσι(ν)" }
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ βασιλεὺς τοὺς πολίτας σώσει."
        english: "The king will save the citizens."
        notes: "σώσει is future of σῴζω; dental stem drops dental before σ."
      - greek: "γράψομεν τὰς ἐπιστολάς."
        english: "We shall write the letters."

    subcategory: verb_conjugation
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Future Active Indicative", "Present Middle/Passive Indicative"]
    description: >
      The future middle uses the future stem (with σ) plus primary middle
      endings: -σομαι, -σῃ/-σει, -σεται, -σόμεθα, -σεσθε, -σονται. Many
      deponent verbs (active in meaning but middle/passive in form) appear
      only in the future middle. The future passive uses a separate formation
      with -θησ-.
    paradigm:
      model: "λύσομαι (I shall release for myself)"
      singular: { 1s: "λύσομαι", 2s: "λύσῃ", 3s: "λύσεται" }

    prerequisites: ["Imperfect Active Indicative"]
    description: >
      The aorist expresses a simple, undefined past action (in contrast to the
      imperfect's continuous past). The first (sigmatic) aorist adds -σα- to
      the verb stem with augment and secondary endings: ἔλυσα, ἔλυσας, ἔλυσε,
      ἐλύσαμεν, ἐλύσατε, ἔλυσαν. The same consonant changes as in the future
      apply before σ.
    paradigm:

      The second (strong) aorist uses a different stem from the present
      (ablaut) but takes the same endings as the imperfect: augment + aorist
      stem + secondary endings (-ον, -ες, -ε, -ομεν, -ετε, -ον). Common
      second aorists include ἔλαβον (λαμβάνω), ἔλιπον (λείπω), ἔβαλον
      (βάλλω), ἦλθον (ἔρχομαι).
    paradigm:
      model: "ἔλαβον (I took) — from λαμβάνω"

      The aorist middle uses the aorist stem with secondary middle endings.
      First aorist middle: -σάμην, -σω, -σατο, -σάμεθα, -σασθε, -σαντο.
      Second aorist middle: -όμην, -ου, -ετο, -όμεθα, -εσθε, -οντο (same
      as imperfect middle endings on the aorist stem). Many deponent verbs
      have aorist middle forms.
    paradigm:

    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["First Aorist Active Indicative"]
    description: >
      Unlike the present and imperfect, the aorist has a separate passive
      formation. The first aorist passive adds -θη- to the verb stem with
      augment and active secondary endings: ἐλύθην, ἐλύθης, ἐλύθη, ἐλύθημεν,
      ἐλύθητε, ἐλύθησαν. The second aorist passive uses -η- without θ
      (e.g., ἐγράφην from γράφω).
    paradigm:

      The perfect expresses a completed action with a present resulting state.
      It is formed with reduplication (repeating the initial consonant + ε),
      the verb stem, the tense marker -κ-, and special perfect endings:
      -κα, -κας, -κε, -καμεν, -κατε, -κασι(ν). Aspirate-initial verbs
      reduplicate with the corresponding unaspirated stop (φ → πε-, θ → τε-,
      χ → κε-). Vowel-initial verbs lengthen the vowel.
    paradigm:
      model: "λέλυκα (I have released)"

      The perfect middle/passive uses reduplication and primary middle endings
      added directly to the stem (no thematic vowel or κ): -μαι, -σαι, -ται,
      -μεθα, -σθε, -νται. Consonant stems show assimilation before the
      endings. The third plural often requires a periphrastic form
      (participle + εἰσί). This tense is important for expressing states.
    paradigm:
      model: "λέλυμαι (I have been released / I am in a state of release)"
      singular: { 1s: "λέλυμαι", 2s: "λέλυσαι", 3s: "λέλυται" }

      The subjunctive mood expresses possibility, exhortation, purpose, or
      fear. It is formed by lengthening the thematic vowel: ο → ω, ε → η.
      Present subjunctive uses the present stem; aorist subjunctive uses the
      unaugmented aorist stem. The subjunctive has only primary endings and
      no past-time reference. Active: -ω, -ῃς, -ῃ, -ωμεν, -ητε, -ωσι(ν).
