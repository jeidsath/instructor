  - name: "Present Active Participle"
    subcategory: participle
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Indicative", "Third Declension Consonant Stems"]
    description: >
      The present active participle expresses ongoing action simultaneous with
      the main verb. It is formed from the present stem with the suffix
      -ων, -ουσα, -ον (gen. -οντος, -ούσης, -οντος). The masculine and
      neuter follow the third declension (ντ-stem), the feminine follows the
      first declension. Participles function as adjectives, substantives, or
      adverbial modifiers (circumstantial participle).
    paradigm:
      model: "λύων, λύουσα, λῦον (releasing)"
      masculine: { nom: "λύων", gen: "λύοντος", dat: "λύοντι", acc: "λύοντα" }
      feminine: { nom: "λύουσα", gen: "λυούσης", dat: "λυούσῃ", acc: "λύουσαν" }
      neuter: { nom: "λῦον", gen: "λύοντος", dat: "λύοντι", acc: "λῦον" }
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ στρατηγὸς λέγων ἔπεισε τοὺς πολίτας."
        english: "The general, (while) speaking, persuaded the citizens."
        notes: "Circumstantial participle expressing simultaneous action."
      - greek: "οἱ ἀκούοντες ἐθαύμαζον."
        english: "Those listening were amazed."
        notes: "Substantive use: article + participle = 'those who are Xing.'"

  - name: "Present Middle/Passive Participle"
    subcategory: participle
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Present Middle/Passive Indicative", "First and Second Declension Adjectives"]
    description: >
      The present middle/passive participle uses the suffix -όμενος, -ομένη,
      -όμενον, declining like a regular first/second declension adjective.
      It expresses ongoing middle or passive action. Context determines
      whether the meaning is middle (for oneself) or passive (being done to).
      This is the simplest participle to decline.
    paradigm:
      model: "λυόμενος, λυομένη, λυόμενον (releasing for oneself / being released)"
      masculine: { nom: "-όμενος", gen: "-ομένου", dat: "-ομένῳ", acc: "-όμενον" }
      feminine: { nom: "-ομένη", gen: "-ομένης", dat: "-ομένῃ", acc: "-ομένην" }
      neuter: { nom: "-όμενον", gen: "-ομένου", dat: "-ομένῳ", acc: "-όμενον" }
    examples:
      - greek: "ἡ πόλις πολιορκουμένη ἀντεῖχεν."
        english: "The city, being besieged, held out."
        notes: "Passive meaning: πολιορκουμένη modifies ἡ πόλις."
      - greek: "ὁ στρατιώτης παρασκευαζόμενος τὰ ὅπλα ἐξῆλθεν."
        english: "The soldier, preparing his weapons (for himself), went out."
        notes: "Middle meaning: the subject acts in his own interest."

  - name: "Aorist Active Participle"
    subcategory: participle
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["First Aorist Active Indicative", "Present Active Participle"]
    description: >
      The aorist active participle expresses simple (not ongoing) action,
      typically prior to the main verb. First aorist: -σας, -σασα, -σαν
      (gen. -σαντος, -σάσης, -σαντος). Second aorist: -ών, -οῦσα, -όν
      (same endings as present participle but on the aorist stem). The aorist
      participle is extremely common in narrative prose.
    paradigm:
      first_aorist:
        model: "λύσας, λύσασα, λῦσαν (having released)"
        masculine: { nom: "λύσας", gen: "λύσαντος", dat: "λύσαντι", acc: "λύσαντα" }
        feminine: { nom: "λύσασα", gen: "λυσάσης", dat: "λυσάσῃ", acc: "λύσασαν" }
      second_aorist:
        model: "λαβών, λαβοῦσα, λαβόν (having taken)"
        masculine: { nom: "λαβών", gen: "λαβόντος", dat: "λαβόντι", acc: "λαβόντα" }

    subcategory: participle
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Aorist Middle Indicative", "Present Middle/Passive Participle"]
    description: >
      The aorist middle participle uses -σάμενος, -σαμένη, -σάμενον (first
      aorist) or -όμενος, -ομένη, -όμενον on the second aorist stem. It
      declines like a regular first/second declension adjective. Many
      deponent verbs use aorist middle participles with active meaning.
    paradigm:
      first_aorist:
        model: "λυσάμενος, λυσαμένη, λυσάμενον (having released for oneself)"
        masculine: { nom: "-σάμενος", gen: "-σαμένου", dat: "-σαμένῳ", acc: "-σάμενον" }

    subcategory: participle
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Aorist Passive Indicative", "Present Middle/Passive Participle"]
    description: >
      The aorist passive participle is formed with -θείς, -θεῖσα, -θέν
      (first aorist passive) or -είς, -εῖσα, -έν (second aorist passive).
      The masculine and neuter decline like third-declension ντ-stems, the
      feminine like a first-declension noun. This participle is common in
      expressions of being affected by an action.
    paradigm:
      first_aorist_passive:

    prerequisites: ["Perfect Active Indicative", "Present Active Participle"]

      The perfect active participle expresses a completed action with a
      present resulting state. It is formed with reduplication + perfect stem
      + -κώς, -κυῖα, -κός (gen. -κότος, -κυίας, -κότος). The masculine and
      neuter are third declension, the feminine first declension. This
      participle emphasizes the state resulting from a completed action.

      The perfect middle/passive participle is formed with reduplication +
      verb stem + -μένος, -μένη, -μένον. It declines like a regular first/
      second declension adjective, making it the easiest perfect participle
      to recognize. It expresses a state resulting from a completed middle
      or passive action and is used in periphrastic perfect constructions.
    paradigm:
      model: "λελυμένος, λελυμένη, λελυμένον (having been released)"
