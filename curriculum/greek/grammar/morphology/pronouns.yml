    subcategory: pronoun
    difficulty: 2
    prerequisites: []
    description: >
      Greek personal pronouns exist for 1st person (ἐγώ) and 2nd person (σύ).
      For 3rd person, Greek uses αὐτός, αὐτή, αὐτό in oblique cases. The
      forms are: ἐγώ, ἐμοῦ/μου, ἐμοί/μοι, ἐμέ/με (1st sg.); σύ, σοῦ/σου,
      σοί/σοι, σέ/σε (2nd sg.). Emphatic (accented) and unemphatic (enclitic)
      forms exist. Nominative pronouns are used only for emphasis since the
      verb ending shows person.
    paradigm:
      first_person:
        singular: { nom: "ἐγώ", gen: "ἐμοῦ/μου", dat: "ἐμοί/μοι", acc: "ἐμέ/με" }
        plural: { nom: "ἡμεῖς", gen: "ἡμῶν", dat: "ἡμῖν", acc: "ἡμᾶς" }
      second_person:
        singular: { nom: "σύ", gen: "σοῦ/σου", dat: "σοί/σοι", acc: "σέ/σε" }
        plural: { nom: "ὑμεῖς", gen: "ὑμῶν", dat: "ὑμῖν", acc: "ὑμᾶς" }
    examples:
      - greek: "ἐγὼ μὲν λέγω, σὺ δὲ ἀκούεις."
        english: "I speak, but you listen."
        notes: "Emphatic nominative pronouns used for contrast with μέν...δέ."
      - greek: "πέμψον μοι τὸ βιβλίον."
        english: "Send me the book."
        notes: "μοι is the unemphatic (enclitic) dative form."

  - name: "Demonstrative Pronouns"
    subcategory: pronoun
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Personal Pronouns"]
    description: >
      Greek has three demonstratives: οὗτος/αὕτη/τοῦτο (this, the latter),
      ἐκεῖνος/ἐκείνη/ἐκεῖνο (that, the former), and ὅδε/ἥδε/τόδε (this
      here). οὗτος follows a pattern where τ- appears where the article has τ-,
      and the stem vowel alternates (ου- with ο/ω endings, αυ- with η/α
      endings). When used with a noun, demonstratives stand in the predicate
      position (outside the article-noun group).
    paradigm:
      houtos:
        model: "οὗτος, αὕτη, τοῦτο (this)"
        masculine: { nom: "οὗτος", gen: "τούτου", dat: "τούτῳ", acc: "τοῦτον" }
        feminine: { nom: "αὕτη", gen: "ταύτης", dat: "ταύτῃ", acc: "ταύτην" }
        neuter: { nom: "τοῦτο", gen: "τούτου", dat: "τούτῳ", acc: "τοῦτο" }
    examples:
      - greek: "οὗτος ὁ ἀνὴρ σοφός ἐστιν."
        english: "This man is wise."
        notes: "Predicate position: demonstrative outside the article-noun group."
      - greek: "ἐκεῖνοι οἱ στρατιῶται ἀνδρεῖοι ἦσαν."
        english: "Those soldiers were brave."
        notes: "ἐκεῖνοι refers to something more remote (in time or space)."

  - name: "Relative Pronouns"
    subcategory: pronoun
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Demonstrative Pronouns"]
    description: >
      The relative pronoun ὅς, ἥ, ὅ (who, which, that) introduces relative
      clauses. It agrees with its antecedent in gender and number but takes
      its case from its function within the relative clause. Greek often
      shows attraction of the relative into the case of its antecedent,
      especially from accusative into genitive or dative. The indefinite
      relative ὅστις (whoever) combines ὅς with τις.
    paradigm:
      model: "ὅς, ἥ, ὅ (who, which)"
      masculine: { nom: "ὅς", gen: "οὗ", dat: "ᾧ", acc: "ὅν" }
      feminine: { nom: "ἥ", gen: "ἧς", dat: "ᾗ", acc: "ἥν" }
      neuter: { nom: "ὅ", gen: "οὗ", dat: "ᾧ", acc: "ὅ" }
    examples:
      - greek: "ὁ ἀνὴρ ὃν εἶδον σοφός ἐστιν."
        english: "The man whom I saw is wise."
        notes: "ὅν is accusative (object of εἶδον), agreeing with ἀνήρ in gender/number."
      - greek: "ἡ πόλις ἐξ ἧς ἦλθον μεγάλη ἐστίν."
        english: "The city from which I came is large."
        notes: "Relative attraction not shown here; ἧς is genitive after ἐξ."

  - name: "Interrogative and Indefinite Pronouns"
    subcategory: pronoun
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Personal Pronouns"]
    description: >
      The interrogative τίς, τί (who? what?) and the indefinite τις, τι
      (someone, something) are identical in form except for accent. The
      interrogative always has an acute on the first syllable; the indefinite
      is enclitic (unaccented or with recessive accent). Both decline like
      third-declension nouns with stem τιν-. The interrogative introduces
      direct and indirect questions.
    paradigm:
      model: "τίς, τί (who? what?) / τις, τι (someone, something)"
      masculine_feminine: { nom: "τίς", gen: "τίνος/τοῦ", dat: "τίνι/τῷ", acc: "τίνα" }
      neuter: { nom: "τί", gen: "τίνος/τοῦ", dat: "τίνι/τῷ", acc: "τί" }
    examples:
      - greek: "τίς ταῦτα ἐποίησεν;"
        english: "Who did these things?"
        notes: "Direct question with interrogative τίς (accented)."
      - greek: "εἶδόν τινα ἐν τῇ ἀγορᾷ."
        english: "I saw someone in the agora."
        notes: "Indefinite τινα (enclitic, unaccented)."

  - name: "Reflexive Pronouns"
    subcategory: pronoun
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Personal Pronouns", "Present Middle/Passive Indicative"]
    description: >
      Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of their clause. They are
      formed by combining the personal pronoun with αὐτός: 1st person
      ἐμαυτοῦ, ἐμαυτῆς (of myself); 2nd person σεαυτοῦ, σεαυτῆς (of
      yourself); 3rd person ἑαυτοῦ, ἑαυτῆς, ἑαυτοῦ (of himself/herself/
      itself). Reflexives have no nominative form. In the plural 3rd person,
      σφῶν αὐτῶν may be used.
    paradigm:
      first_person:
        singular_masc: { gen: "ἐμαυτοῦ", dat: "ἐμαυτῷ", acc: "ἐμαυτόν" }
        singular_fem: { gen: "ἐμαυτῆς", dat: "ἐμαυτῇ", acc: "ἐμαυτήν" }
      third_person:
        singular_masc: { gen: "ἑαυτοῦ", dat: "ἑαυτῷ", acc: "ἑαυτόν" }
        singular_fem: { gen: "ἑαυτῆς", dat: "ἑαυτῇ", acc: "ἑαυτήν" }
    examples:
      - greek: "γνῶθι σεαυτόν."
        english: "Know yourself."
        notes: "The famous Delphic maxim. σεαυτόν is 2nd person reflexive acc."
      - greek: "ὁ στρατηγὸς ἑαυτὸν ἔσωσεν."
        english: "The general saved himself."
        notes: "3rd person reflexive ἑαυτόν refers back to the subject."
