  Hannibal, dux Carthāginiēnsis, Alpēs cum exercitū trānsīvit.
  Iter difficile erat. Multī mīlitēs et elephantī in montibus periērunt.
  Hannibal tamen cōpiās in Italiam dūxit. Rōmānī magnō timōre affectī sunt.
  Tribus proeliīs Hannibal Rōmānōs vīcit. Ad Cannās maximam clādem Rōmānīs intulit.
  Sed Rōmānī nōn sē dēdidērunt. Novōs exercitūs comparāvērunt.
  Multōs annōs Hannibal in Italiā mānsit, sed Rōmam capere nōn potuit.
translation: |
  Hannibal, a Carthaginian general, crossed the Alps with his army.
  The journey was difficult. Many soldiers and elephants perished in the mountains.
  Hannibal nevertheless led his forces into Italy. The Romans were struck with great fear.
  In three battles Hannibal defeated the Romans. At Cannae he inflicted the greatest defeat on the Romans.
  But the Romans did not surrender. They assembled new armies.
  For many years Hannibal remained in Italy, but he could not capture Rome.
