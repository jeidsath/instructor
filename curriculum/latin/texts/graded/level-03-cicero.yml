  Mārcus Tullius Cicerō, clārissimus ōrātōrum Rōmānōrum, multōs annōs rem pūblicam dēfendit.
  Ōrātiōnēs eius in senātū habitae ab omnibus laudābantur.
  Cum Catilīna coniūrātiōnem contrā rem pūblicam fēcisset, Cicerō eam dētēxit.
  Catilīna ē senātū ēiectus est et cum sociīs suīs fūgit.
  Cicerō ā populō "pater patriae" appellātus est. Haec victōria eī magnam glōriam dedit.
  Posteā tamen ab inimīcīs in exsilium pulsus est. Sed brevī tempore revocātus est.
translation: |
  Marcus Tullius Cicero, the most famous of Roman orators, defended the republic for many years.
  His speeches delivered in the senate were praised by everyone.
  When Catiline had made a conspiracy against the republic, Cicero exposed it.
  Catiline was thrown out of the senate and fled with his associates.
  Cicero was called "father of the fatherland" by the people. This victory gave him great glory.
  Later however he was driven into exile by enemies. But within a short time he was recalled.
