  Rēgulus, dux Rōmānus, ā Carthāginiēnsibus captus et Rōmam missus est
  ut pācem peteret et captīvōs Pūnicōs redimeret. Iūreiūrandō obligātus erat
  sē Carthāginem reditūrum esse sī Rōmānī condiciōnēs nōn accēpissent.
  In senātū autem Rēgulus contrārium fēcit: suāsit nē pāx fieret
  et nē captīvī redderentur. "Captīvī illī," inquit, "nōn sunt dignī
  quī redīmantur. Ego autem, quamquam mortem meam sciō, fidem servābō."
  Sīc Rēgulus Carthāginem rediit et ā hostibus crūdēliter necātus est.
  Exemplum fidēī eius ā Rōmānīs semper laudātum est.
translation: |
  Regulus, a Roman general, was captured by the Carthaginians and sent to Rome
  to seek peace and ransom the Punic captives. He was bound by an oath
  to return to Carthage if the Romans did not accept the terms.
  In the senate however Regulus did the opposite: he urged that peace not be made
  and that the captives not be returned. "Those captives," he said, "are not worthy
  of being ransomed. But I, although I know my death is coming, will keep my word."
  Thus Regulus returned to Carthage and was cruelly killed by the enemy.
  The example of his loyalty was always praised by the Romans.
