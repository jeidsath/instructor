  Mercātor Rōmānus iter longum faciēbat. Ab urbe Rōmā ad Graeciam nāvigābat.
  Nāvis parva erat sed nauta perītus eam regēbat. Mare tranquillum erat.
  Tertio diē ventus magnus vēnit. Undae altae nāvem quassābant.
  Mercātor timēbat, sed nauta nāvem servāvit. Tandem ad portum pervēnērunt.
  "Grātiās deīs agō!" mercātor exclāmāvit. In terrā Graecā tūtus erat.

  A Roman merchant was making a long journey. He was sailing from the city of Rome to Greece.
  The ship was small but a skilled sailor was steering it. The sea was calm.
  On the third day a great wind came. High waves were battering the ship.
  The merchant was afraid, but the sailor saved the ship. At last they arrived at the port.
  "I give thanks to the gods!" the merchant exclaimed. He was safe on Greek land.
