difficulty: 6
content: |
  Orpheus, poēta nōbilissimus, uxōrem Eurydīcēn maximē amābat.
  Eurydīcē autem ā serpente morsa mortua est. Orpheus, dolōre victus, ad Īnferōs dēscendit.
  Carmina tam pulchra cecinit ut Cerberus, canis trīceps, quiēsceret.
  Plūtō et Prōserpina, eius cantū commōtī, Eurydīcēn eī reddidērunt.
  Ūna tamen condiciō posita est: Orpheus nōn dēbēbat uxōrem respicere
  dum ex Īnferīs ascenderet. Orpheus per longam viam dūcēbat.
  Prope exitum, timōre superātus, sē convertit et Eurydīcēn respexit.
  Illa statim in umbrās retracta est. Orpheus eam iterum āmīsit.
translation: |
  Orpheus, a most noble poet, loved his wife Eurydice very much.
  But Eurydice, bitten by a serpent, died. Orpheus, overcome by grief, descended to the Underworld.
  He sang songs so beautiful that Cerberus, the three-headed dog, grew quiet.
  Pluto and Proserpina, moved by his singing, returned Eurydice to him.
  One condition, however, was set: Orpheus was not to look back at his wife
  while ascending from the Underworld. Orpheus was leading the way along the long road.
  Near the exit, overcome by fear, he turned and looked back at Eurydice.
  She was immediately drawn back into the shadows. Orpheus lost her again.
