  Plīnius amīcō suō Tacitō salūtem dīcit.
  Petīs ut tibi scrībam quōmodo māter mea et ego ē perīculō ēvāserimus.
  Mīsēnus sub Vesuviō iacēbat. Nūbēs ātra ē monte surgēbat.
  Avunculus meus, vir fortissimus, nāvem parārī iussit ut propius accēderet.
  Cinis et lapidēs in nāvem cadēbant. Fluctūs magnī nāvem impediēbant.
  Ille tamen nōn sē vertit. Ad lītus pervēnit et amīcōs territōs cōnsōlātus est.
  Postrīdiē corpus eius in lītore inventum est. Vultu placidō iacēbat,
  dormientī similior quam mortuō.

  Pliny says greetings to his friend Tacitus.
  You ask me to write to you how my mother and I escaped from danger.
  Misenum lay below Vesuvius. A dark cloud was rising from the mountain.
  My uncle, a very brave man, ordered a ship to be prepared so he could approach closer.
  Ash and stones were falling on the ship. Great waves were hindering the ship.
  He nevertheless did not turn back. He reached the shore and consoled his terrified friends.
  The next day his body was found on the shore. He was lying with a peaceful expression,
  more like someone sleeping than dead.
