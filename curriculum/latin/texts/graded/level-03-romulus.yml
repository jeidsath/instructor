  Rōmulus et Remus ā lupa nūtrītī sunt. Puerī ā pāstōre inventī et ēducātī sunt.
  Cum adulēscentēs factī essent, urbem novam condere cōnstituērunt.
  Sed dē locō urbis inter sē contendēbant. Rōmulus Palātīnum montem ēlēgit;
  Remus Aventīnum praetulerat. Uterque avēs observāvit ut deōrum voluntātem cognōsceret.
  Rōmulō duodecim vulturēs vīsī sunt; Remō sex tantum. Rōmulus igitur urbem
  suam Rōmam appellāvit. Mūrus ab eō aedificātus est.
  Remus autem mūrum parvum trānsīluit et ā Rōmulō occīsus est.
translation: |
  Romulus and Remus were nursed by a she-wolf. The boys were found and raised by a shepherd.
  When they had become young men, they decided to found a new city.
  But they were quarreling about the location of the city. Romulus chose the Palatine Hill;
  Remus had preferred the Aventine. Each observed the birds to learn the will of the gods.
  Twelve vultures were seen by Romulus; only six by Remus. Therefore Romulus
  named his city Roma. A wall was built by him.
  But Remus jumped over the small wall and was killed by Romulus.
