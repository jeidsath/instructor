  Arma virumque canō, Trōiae quī prīmus ab ōrīs
  Ītaliam, fātō profugus, Lāvīniaque vēnit
  lītora, multum ille et terrīs iactātus et altō
  vī superum saevae memorem Iūnōnis ob īram,
  multa quoque et bellō passūs, dum conderet urbem,
  īnferretque deōs Latiō, genus unde Latīnum,
  Albānīque patrēs, atque altae moenia Rōmae.
  Mūsa, mihī causās memorā, quō nūmine laesō,
  quidve dolēns, rēgīna deum tot volvere cāsūs
  īnsignem pietāte virum, tot adīre labōrēs
  impulerit. Tantaene animīs caelestibus īrae?
translation: |
  I sing of arms and the man who first from the shores of Troy,
  an exile by fate, came to Italy and the Lavinian shores,
  much tossed about both on land and on the deep
  by the violence of the gods above on account of the unforgetting wrath of cruel Juno,
  having also suffered much in war, until he could found a city
  and bring his gods to Latium, whence came the Latin race,
  the Alban fathers, and the walls of lofty Rome.
  Muse, recall to me the causes — by what divine will offended,
  or grieving at what, the queen of the gods drove a man remarkable
  for his piety to undergo so many misfortunes, to face so many toils.
  Can there be such anger in heavenly spirits?
