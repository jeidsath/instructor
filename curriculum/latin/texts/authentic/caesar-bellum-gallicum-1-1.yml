  Gallia est omnis dīvīsa in partēs trēs, quārum ūnam incolunt Belgae,
  aliam Aquītānī, tertiam quī ipsōrum linguā Celtae, nostrā Gallī appellantur.
  Hī omnēs linguā, īnstitūtīs, lēgibus inter sē differunt. Gallōs ab Aquītānīs
  Garumna flūmen, ā Belgīs Matrona et Sēquana dīvidit.
  Hōrum omnium fortissimī sunt Belgae, proptereā quod ā cultū atque hūmānitāte
  prōvinciae longissimē absunt, minimēque ad eōs mercātōrēs saepe commeant
  atque ea quae ad effēminandōs animōs pertinent important.
translation: |
  Gaul as a whole is divided into three parts, of which the Belgae inhabit one,
  the Aquitani another, and those who in their own language are called Celts,
  in ours Gauls, the third. All these differ among themselves in language,
  customs, and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from the Aquitani,
  the Marne and Seine separate them from the Belgae.
  Of all these the Belgae are the bravest, because they are farthest removed
  from the civilization and culture of the Province, and merchants least frequently
  travel to them and import those things which tend to make spirits soft.
