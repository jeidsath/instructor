  Quō ūsque tandem abūtēre, Catilīna, patientiā nostrā?
  Quam diū etiam furor iste tuus nōs ēlūdet?
  Quem ad fīnem sēsē effrēnāta iactābit audācia?
  Nihilne tē nocturnum praesidium Palātiī, nihil urbis vigiliae,
  nihil timor populī, nihil cōnsēnsus bonōrum omnium,
  nihil hīc mūnītissimus habendī senātūs locus,
  nihil hōrum ōra vultūsque mōvērunt?
  Patēre tua cōnsilia nōn sentīs? Cōnstrictam iam hōrum omnium
  scientiā tenērī coniūrātiōnem tuam nōn vidēs?
translation: |
  How far, finally, will you abuse our patience, Catiline?
  How long will that madness of yours still elude us?
  To what limit will your unbridled audacity flaunt itself?
  Did the nightly guard of the Palatine not move you at all, nor the watches of the city,
  nor the fear of the people, nor the agreement of all good men,
  nor this most fortified place for holding the senate,
  nor the faces and expressions of these men?
  Do you not perceive that your plans lie open? Do you not see that your conspiracy
  is already held in check by the knowledge of all these men?
