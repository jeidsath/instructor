  - name: "First Declension"
    subcategory: noun_declension
    difficulty: 1
    prerequisites: []
    description: >
      Nouns of the first declension are predominantly feminine and have
      stems ending in -a. The nominative singular ends in -a and the
      genitive singular in -ae. A small number of first declension nouns
      are masculine (e.g., agricola, nauta, poēta), but they decline
      identically. This is the simplest declension and serves as the
      foundation for learning the Latin case system.
    paradigm:
      model_word: "puella, -ae (f.) girl"
      cases:
        nominative: { singular: "-a", plural: "-ae" }
        genitive: { singular: "-ae", plural: "-ārum" }
        dative: { singular: "-ae", plural: "-īs" }
        accusative: { singular: "-am", plural: "-ās" }
        ablative: { singular: "-ā", plural: "-īs" }
        vocative: { singular: "-a", plural: "-ae" }
    examples:
      - latin: "Puella aquam portat."
        english: "The girl carries water."
        notes: "puella is nominative singular (subject); aquam is accusative singular (direct object)."
      - latin: "Agricola fīliārum terram arat."
        english: "The farmer ploughs the land of his daughters."
        notes: "agricola is a masculine first-declension noun; fīliārum is genitive plural."

  - name: "Second Declension"
    subcategory: noun_declension
    difficulty: 2
    prerequisites: ["First Declension"]
    description: >
      Nouns of the second declension are predominantly masculine (ending in
      -us or -er) or neuter (ending in -um). The genitive singular ends in
      -ī. Masculine nouns in -us form the vocative singular in -e (exception:
      proper nouns in -ius often have vocative -ī, e.g. Vergili). Some
      masculine nouns end in -er: a few retain the -e- throughout (puer,
      puerī), while most drop it (ager, agrī). Neuter nouns in -um are
      treated separately in the next concept.
    paradigm:
      model_word: "servus, -ī (m.) slave"
      notes:
        - "Nouns in -er: puer, puerī (boy) retains e; ager, agrī (field) drops e."
        - "The vocative singular of -us nouns is -e (serve!); all other forms match nominative."
      cases:
        nominative: { singular: "-us", plural: "-ī" }
        genitive: { singular: "-ī", plural: "-ōrum" }
        dative: { singular: "-ō", plural: "-īs" }
        accusative: { singular: "-um", plural: "-ōs" }
        ablative: { singular: "-ō", plural: "-īs" }
        vocative: { singular: "-e", plural: "-ī" }
    examples:
      - latin: "Servus dominum videt."
        english: "The slave sees the master."
        notes: "servus is nominative singular (subject); dominum is accusative singular (direct object)."
      - latin: "Puer in agrō lūdit."
        english: "The boy plays in the field."
        notes: "puer is a second-declension -er noun that retains the e; agrō is ablative singular with preposition in."

  - name: "Second Declension Neuter"
    subcategory: noun_declension
    difficulty: 2
    prerequisites: ["Second Declension"]
    description: >
      Neuter nouns of the second declension end in -um in the nominative
      singular and follow the same genitive (-ī) as masculine second-
      declension nouns. The critical rule for all Latin neuter nouns applies
      here: the nominative, accusative, and vocative forms are always
      identical. In the plural, these three cases all end in -a. This
      pattern recurs in every declension that contains neuter nouns.
    paradigm:
      model_word: "bellum, -ī (n.) war"
      notes:
        - "Neuter rule: nominative = accusative = vocative in both singular and plural."
        - "Plural nom./acc./voc. ending -a is the hallmark of all Latin neuters."
      cases:
        nominative: { singular: "-um", plural: "-a" }
        genitive: { singular: "-ī", plural: "-ōrum" }
        dative: { singular: "-ō", plural: "-īs" }
        accusative: { singular: "-um", plural: "-a" }
        ablative: { singular: "-ō", plural: "-īs" }
        vocative: { singular: "-um", plural: "-a" }
    examples:
      - latin: "Bellum est malum."
        english: "War is an evil."
        notes: "bellum is nominative neuter; malum is a predicate nominative neuter noun/adjective."
      - latin: "Dōna templōrum magna sunt."
        english: "The gifts of the temples are great."
        notes: "dōna is nominative/accusative neuter plural; templōrum is genitive plural."

  - name: "Third Declension"
    subcategory: noun_declension
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["First Declension", "Second Declension"]
    description: >
      The third declension is the largest and most varied of the five Latin
      declensions. It contains nouns of all three genders. The genitive
      singular always ends in -is, which is the key identifier. The
      nominative singular varies widely and often cannot predict the stem;
      therefore, the genitive must always be memorised alongside the
      nominative. Third-declension nouns fall into two broad groups:
      consonant stems (the majority) and i-stems (treated in the next
      concept). Consonant-stem nouns have genitive plural -um, ablative
      singular -e, and neuter nominative/accusative plural -a.
    paradigm:
      model_word: "rex, regis (m.) king"
      notes:
        - "The stem is found by removing -is from the genitive singular: reg-."
        - "Consonant stems vs. i-stems differ in gen. pl. (-um vs. -ium), abl. sg. (-e vs. -ī for neuters), and neut. nom./acc. pl. (-a vs. -ia)."
      cases:
        nominative: { singular: "(varies)", plural: "-ēs" }
        genitive: { singular: "-is", plural: "-um" }
        dative: { singular: "-ī", plural: "-ibus" }
        accusative: { singular: "-em", plural: "-ēs" }
        ablative: { singular: "-e", plural: "-ibus" }
        vocative: { singular: "(= nom.)", plural: "-ēs" }
    examples:
      - latin: "Rēx populum regit."
        english: "The king rules the people."
        notes: "rēx is nominative singular; the stem reg- is visible in the genitive regis."
      - latin: "Mīlitēs ducis iussa audiunt."
        english: "The soldiers hear the commands of the leader."
        notes: "mīlitēs is nom. pl.; ducis is gen. sg. of dux, ducis (leader)."

  - name: "Third Declension i-Stems"
    subcategory: noun_declension
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Third Declension"]
    description: >
      A significant subset of third-declension nouns are classified as
      i-stems. These nouns retain an -i- in certain endings where consonant
      stems do not. The key differences are: genitive plural -ium (instead
      of -um), and for neuter i-stems, ablative singular -ī (instead of -e)
      and nominative/accusative plural -ia (instead of -a). Masculine and
      feminine i-stems include parisyllabic nouns (same number of syllables
      in nominative and genitive, e.g. civis, civis) and nouns whose stem
      ends in two consonants (e.g. urbs, urbis). Neuter i-stems end in -e,
      -al, or -ar (e.g. mare, animal, calcar).
    paradigm:
      model_word: "civis, civis (m./f.) citizen"
      notes:
        - "Key i-stem markers: gen. pl. -ium, neut. abl. sg. -ī, neut. nom./acc. pl. -ia."
        - "Identifying i-stems: parisyllabics (civis, -is), double-consonant stems (urbs, urbis), neuters in -e/-al/-ar."
      cases:
        nominative: { singular: "(varies)", plural: "-ēs" }
        genitive: { singular: "-is", plural: "-ium" }
        dative: { singular: "-ī", plural: "-ibus" }
        accusative: { singular: "-em", plural: "-ēs / -īs" }
        ablative: { singular: "-e", plural: "-ibus" }
        vocative: { singular: "(= nom.)", plural: "-ēs" }
      neuter_i_stem:
        model_word: "mare, maris (n.) sea"
        cases:
          nominative: { singular: "-e", plural: "-ia" }
          genitive: { singular: "-is", plural: "-ium" }

          ablative: { singular: "-ī", plural: "-ibus" }
          vocative: { singular: "-e", plural: "-ia" }
    examples:
      - latin: "Cīvēs urbis lēgēs servant."
        english: "The citizens of the city observe the laws."
        notes: "cīvēs is nom. pl. i-stem; urbis is gen. sg. of urbs (also an i-stem, stem ending in two consonants)."
      - latin: "Maria et flūmina patriam dēfendunt."
        english: "Seas and rivers defend the fatherland."
        notes: "maria is nom./acc. neuter i-stem plural of mare (ending -ia, not -a)."

  - name: "Fourth Declension"
    subcategory: noun_declension
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Third Declension"]
    description: >
      The fourth declension contains mostly masculine nouns ending in -us
      (genitive singular -ūs) and a small number of neuter nouns ending
      in -ū. The predominant gender is masculine; the few feminine nouns
      (manus, domus, īdūs) must be memorised. The dative and ablative
      plural end in -ibus (or occasionally -ubus to avoid ambiguity, e.g.
      arcubus). Neuter fourth-declension nouns (cornū, genū) follow the
      standard neuter rule: nominative = accusative = vocative.
    paradigm:
      model_word: "manus, -ūs (f.) hand"
      notes:
        - "Most fourth-declension nouns are masculine; manus and domus are notable feminines."
        - "Neuter type: cornū, cornūs (n.) horn — nom./acc./voc. sg. -ū, pl. -ua."
      cases:
        nominative: { singular: "-us", plural: "-ūs" }
        genitive: { singular: "-ūs", plural: "-uum" }
        dative: { singular: "-uī", plural: "-ibus" }
        accusative: { singular: "-um", plural: "-ūs" }
        ablative: { singular: "-ū", plural: "-ibus" }
        vocative: { singular: "-us", plural: "-ūs" }
      neuter_type:
        model_word: "cornū, -ūs (n.) horn"

          ablative: { singular: "-ū", plural: "-ibus" }
          vocative: { singular: "-ū", plural: "-ua" }
    examples:
      - latin: "Manus mīlitum gladiōs tenent."
        english: "The hands of the soldiers hold swords."
        notes: "manus is nom. pl. (4th decl.); mīlitum is gen. pl. (3rd decl.)."
      - latin: "Exercitus ad portum vēnit."
        english: "The army came to the harbor."
        notes: "exercitus is nom. sg. (4th decl.); portum is acc. sg. (2nd decl.)."

  - name: "Fifth Declension"
    subcategory: noun_declension
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Fourth Declension"]
    description: >
      The fifth declension is the smallest Latin declension. All fifth-
      declension nouns end in -ēs in the nominative singular and -eī or
      -ēī in the genitive singular. Nearly all are feminine; the one
      important exception is diēs, which is usually masculine (but
      feminine when referring to an appointed date or period). Only rēs
      and diēs are fully declined in both singular and plural; most other
      fifth-declension nouns lack some or all plural forms. Despite its
      small size, this declension is important because rēs and diēs are
      extremely common words.
    paradigm:
      model_word: "rēs, reī (f.) thing, affair"
      notes:
        - "Only rēs and diēs have complete plural forms."
        - "diēs is usually masculine; other 5th-declension nouns are feminine."
        - "The genitive and dative singular -eī contracts to -ēī after a consonant (fidēī from fidēs)."
      cases:
        nominative: { singular: "-ēs", plural: "-ēs" }
        genitive: { singular: "-eī / -ēī", plural: "-ērum" }
        dative: { singular: "-eī / -ēī", plural: "-ēbus" }
        accusative: { singular: "-em", plural: "-ēs" }
        ablative: { singular: "-ē", plural: "-ēbus" }
        vocative: { singular: "-ēs", plural: "-ēs" }
    examples:
      - latin: "Rēs pūblica ā cīvibus dēfenditur."
        english: "The republic is defended by the citizens."
        notes: "rēs pūblica (lit. 'public thing') is the standard term for republic; ā cīvibus is ablative of agent."
      - latin: "Diēs longus erat."
        english: "The day was long."
        notes: "diēs is nom. sg. masculine; longus agrees in masculine nominative singular."
