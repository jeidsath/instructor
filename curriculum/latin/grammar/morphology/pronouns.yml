    description: >
      Latin has distinct personal pronoun forms for the first person (ego/nōs)
      and second person (tū/vōs). Because Latin is a pro-drop language, the
      nominative forms are used only for emphasis or contrast; the verb ending
      alone normally indicates the subject. The third person has no dedicated
      personal pronoun and instead uses demonstratives such as is/ea/id. All
      personal pronouns decline fully through the six cases.
    paradigm:
      first_person_singular:
        nominative: "ego"
        genitive: "meī"
        dative: "mihi"
        accusative: "mē"
        ablative: "mē"
        vocative: null
      first_person_plural:
        nominative: "nōs"
        genitive: "nostrum / nostrī"
        dative: "nōbīs"
        accusative: "nōs"
        ablative: "nōbīs"
        vocative: null
      second_person_singular:
        nominative: "tū"
        genitive: "tuī"
        dative: "tibi"
        accusative: "tē"
        ablative: "tē"
        vocative: null
      second_person_plural:
        nominative: "vōs"
        genitive: "vestrum / vestrī"
        dative: "vōbīs"
        accusative: "vōs"
        ablative: "vōbīs"
        vocative: null
    examples:
      - latin: "Ego tē amō."
        english: "I love you."
        notes: >
          The nominative ego is expressed here for emphasis; without it the
          verb amō alone would convey 'I love.'
      - latin: "Nōs patriam dēfendimus."
        english: "We defend the fatherland."
        notes: >
          Nōs is emphatic. The verb ending -mus already marks first person
          plural.
      - latin: "Tēcum ambulāre volō."
        english: "I want to walk with you."
        notes: >
          The preposition cum is attached as an enclitic to the ablative of
          personal pronouns: mēcum, tēcum, nōbīscum, vōbīscum.

  - name: "Demonstrative Pronouns"
    subcategory: pronoun_declension
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Personal Pronouns", "Third Declension"]
    description: >
      Latin has three main demonstrative pronouns that indicate varying degrees
      of proximity. Hic/haec/hoc ('this, these') refers to something near the
      speaker. Ille/illa/illud ('that, those') refers to something remote from
      both speaker and listener. Is/ea/id ('this, that, he/she/it') is a
      weaker demonstrative that also serves as the default third-person
      pronoun. All three decline across three genders and five cases (plus
      vocative, which is rarely used). They follow pronominal declension
      patterns with some irregular forms.
    paradigm:
      hic_haec_hoc:

    examples:
      - latin: "Hic liber bonus est."
        english: "This book is good."
        notes: >
          Hic modifies liber and agrees in gender (masculine), number
          (singular), and case (nominative).
      - latin: "Illam puellam vīdī."
        english: "I saw that girl."
        notes: >
          Illam is feminine accusative singular, agreeing with puellam.
      - latin: "Is venit; eum salūtāvimus."
        english: "He came; we greeted him."
        notes: >
          Is/ea/id functions as a third-person pronoun. Is is nominative
          masculine singular; eum is accusative masculine singular.

  - name: "Relative Pronoun"
    subcategory: pronoun_declension
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Demonstrative Pronouns"]
    description: >
      The relative pronoun quī/quae/quod ('who, which, that') introduces
      relative clauses. It agrees with its antecedent in gender and number but
      takes its case from its function within the relative clause. This
      principle of split agreement is a central feature of Latin subordination.
      The forms of the relative pronoun closely resemble those of the
      interrogative adjective.
    paradigm:
      singular:
        masculine:
          nominative: "quī"
          genitive: "cuius"
          dative: "cui"
          accusative: "quem"
          ablative: "quō"
        feminine:
          nominative: "quae"
          genitive: "cuius"
          dative: "cui"
          accusative: "quam"
          ablative: "quā"
        neuter:
          nominative: "quod"
          genitive: "cuius"

          accusative: "quōs"
          ablative: "quibus"

          dative: "quibus"
          accusative: "quae"
          ablative: "quibus"
    examples:
      - latin: "Puella quam vīdī pulchra est."
        english: "The girl whom I saw is beautiful."
        notes: >
          Quam is feminine accusative singular: feminine and singular to agree
          with its antecedent puella, accusative because it is the direct
          object of vīdī in the relative clause.
      - latin: "Mīles cuius gladium cēpī fūgit."
        english: "The soldier whose sword I seized fled."
        notes: >
          Cuius is masculine genitive singular. It is masculine singular to
          agree with mīles and genitive because it shows possession of
          gladium within the relative clause.
      - latin: "Urbs in quā habitāmus magna est."
        english: "The city in which we live is large."
        notes: >
          Quā is feminine ablative singular, governed by the preposition in
          within the relative clause, while agreeing in gender and number
          with the antecedent urbs.

  - name: "Interrogative Pronoun"
    subcategory: pronoun_declension
    difficulty: 5
    prerequisites: ["Relative Pronoun"]
    description: >
      Latin distinguishes between the substantive interrogative pronoun
      quis/quid ('who? what?'), used independently, and the interrogative
      adjective quī/quae/quod ('which? what?'), used to modify a noun. The
      interrogative adjective has forms identical to the relative pronoun. The
      substantive interrogative differs from the relative only in the
      nominative singular masculine (quis vs. quī) and the nominative/accusative
      singular neuter (quid vs. quod). Both are used to introduce direct and
      indirect questions.
    paradigm:
      substantive:
        singular:
          masculine_feminine:
            nominative: "quis"
            genitive: "cuius"
            dative: "cui"
            accusative: "quem"
            ablative: "quō"
          neuter:
            nominative: "quid"
            genitive: "cuius"
            dative: "cui"
            accusative: "quid"
            ablative: "quō"
        plural:
          masculine:
            nominative: "quī"
            genitive: "quōrum"
            dative: "quibus"
            accusative: "quōs"
            ablative: "quibus"
          feminine:
            nominative: "quae"
            genitive: "quārum"
            dative: "quibus"
            accusative: "quās"
            ablative: "quibus"
          neuter:
            nominative: "quae"
            genitive: "quōrum"
            dative: "quibus"
            accusative: "quae"
            ablative: "quibus"
      adjective:
        note: "Identical to the relative pronoun quī/quae/quod in all forms."
    examples:
      - latin: "Quis venit?"
        english: "Who is coming?"
        notes: >
          Quis is the substantive interrogative, nominative singular. Gender
          is determined by the referent.
      - latin: "Quid facis?"
        english: "What are you doing?"
        notes: >
          Quid is the neuter nominative/accusative singular of the
          substantive interrogative.
      - latin: "Quem librum legis?"
        english: "Which book are you reading?"
        notes: >
          Here quem is the interrogative adjective (masculine accusative
          singular), modifying librum. Its form is identical to the relative
          pronoun.

  - name: "Reflexive Pronoun"
    subcategory: pronoun_declension
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Personal Pronouns"]
    description: >
      Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of the clause. In the first
      and second persons, Latin simply reuses the personal pronoun forms (mē,
      tē, nōs, vōs) reflexively. The third person, however, has a dedicated
      reflexive pronoun suī/sibi/sē that is used for all genders and both
      numbers. This pronoun has no nominative form, since by definition the
      reflexive cannot be the subject. The third-person reflexive is
      particularly important in indirect discourse, where it refers back to
      the subject of the main verb.
    paradigm:
      third_person_reflexive:
        nominative: null
        genitive: "suī"
        dative: "sibi"
        accusative: "sē / sēsē"
        ablative: "sē / sēsē"
      note: >
        First and second person reflexives use the standard personal pronoun
        forms (mē, tē, nōs, vōs). The third-person reflexive is invariable
        for gender and number.
    examples:
      - latin: "Sē laudat."
        english: "He praises himself."
        notes: >
          Sē is the third-person reflexive accusative, referring back to the
          subject of laudat.
      - latin: "Sibi nocent."
        english: "They harm themselves."
        notes: >
          Sibi is the reflexive dative. The same form serves for singular and
          plural, masculine and feminine.
      - latin: "Caesar dīxit sē ventūrum esse."
        english: "Caesar said that he (himself) would come."
        notes: >
          In indirect statement, sē refers back to the subject of the main
          verb (Caesar). If eum were used instead, it would refer to someone
          other than Caesar.
      - latin: "Sēcum loquitur."
        english: "He talks with himself."
        notes: >
          As with personal pronouns, cum attaches as an enclitic to the
          reflexive: sēcum.
