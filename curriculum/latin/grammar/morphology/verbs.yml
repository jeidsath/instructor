    description: >
      The present active indicative is the most fundamental Latin verb form,
      expressing an action happening now. Latin has four conjugations,
      distinguished by the vowel of the present stem: first (ā), second (ē),
      third (consonant / short e), and fourth (ī). The personal endings for
      the active voice are -ō/-m, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt. These same
      endings recur across nearly every active tense. The first person
      singular present uniquely ends in -ō rather than -m.
    paradigm:
      personal_endings: ["-ō", "-s", "-t", "-mus", "-tis", "-nt"]

    description: >
      The imperfect active indicative expresses continuous, repeated, or
      ongoing action in the past. It is formed by inserting the tense sign
      -bā- between the present stem and the personal endings. The resulting
      pattern is remarkably regular across all four conjugations: -bam,
      -bās, -bat, -bāmus, -bātis, -bant. In the third and fourth
      conjugations, the stem vowel appears as -ē- before -bam (dūcēbam,
      audiēbam). The imperfect is one of the most regular formations in
      Latin.

    description: >
      The future active indicative expresses action that will happen. Latin
      forms the future differently depending on the conjugation. The first
      and second conjugations use the tense sign -bi- (with variations:
      -bō, -bis, -bit, -bimus, -bitis, -bunt). The third and fourth
      conjugations use a different pattern with the vowel -ē- (except
      first person singular -am): -am, -ēs, -et, -ēmus, -ētis, -ent.
      This split is a frequent source of confusion, since the third/fourth
      conjugation future can resemble present tense forms of other
      conjugations.

    description: >
      The perfect active indicative expresses a completed action in the
      past. It is built on the perfect stem (the third principal part minus
      the -ī ending). The perfect has its own unique set of personal
      endings: -ī, -istī, -it, -imus, -istis, -ērunt (alternative 3rd pl.
      -ēre). These endings are the same for all conjugations, making the
      perfect system more uniform than the present system. The challenge
      lies in learning the perfect stems, which are often unpredictable:
      amō > amāvī, moneō > monuī, dūcō > dūxī, audiō > audīvī.

      The pluperfect active indicative expresses an action completed before
      another past action ("had done"). It is formed by adding the endings
      -eram, -erās, -erat, -erāmus, -erātis, -erant to the perfect stem.
      These endings resemble the imperfect of sum (eram, erās, etc.), which
      provides a useful mnemonic: pluperfect = perfect stem + imperfect of
      "to be." The pluperfect is essential for expressing temporal
      sequences in past narration.

      -eritis, -erint. Note that these endings resemble the future of sum
      (erō, eris, etc.), providing the mnemonic: future perfect = perfect

      the active personal endings with the passive endings: -r (or -or for
      1st sg.), -ris, -tur, -mur, -minī, -ntur. These passive endings
      attach to the same present stems used in the active. The passive

      The perfect passive indicative expresses a completed action received
      by the subject ("has been done" or "was done"). Unlike the active
      perfect, which is a single synthetic form, the passive perfect is a
      compound (periphrastic) tense composed of the perfect passive
      participle (the fourth principal part) plus the present tense of
      sum (esse). The participle is a verbal adjective and must agree with
      the subject in gender, number, and case. This is the first compound
      tense students encounter and introduces the concept of participial
      agreement in the passive system.

    subcategory: verb_conjugation
    difficulty: 2
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Indicative"]
    description: >
      The imperative mood expresses direct commands. Latin has both singular
      and plural imperative forms. The singular imperative is typically the
      bare present stem (amā, monē, dūce / dūc, audī). The plural
      imperative adds -te to the present stem (amāte, monēte, dūcite,
      audīte). Negative commands in classical Latin are not formed with
      the imperative; instead, nōlī (sg.) / nōlīte (pl.) + infinitive is
      used (e.g. nōlī timēre, "do not fear"). A few verbs have irregular
      imperatives: dīc (say), dūc (lead), fac (do), fer (bring).

    description: >
      The present active subjunctive is used in a wide variety of
      subordinate clauses (purpose, result, indirect command, etc.) and in
      independent uses (hortatory, jussive, deliberative). It is formed
      by changing the characteristic vowel of the present stem: 1st
      conjugation changes -ā- to -ē- (amem); 2nd, 3rd, and 4th
      conjugations use -ā- (moneam, dūcam, audiam). The mnemonic for
      the vowel changes is "wE bEAt A lIAr" — ē for 1st, ea for 2nd,
      a for 3rd, ia for 4th. The personal endings are the regular
      active ones (-m, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt), using -m (not -ō)
      in the first person singular.

      The imperfect active subjunctive is one of the easiest forms to
      recognise and produce. It is formed by taking the present active
      infinitive (the second principal part) and adding the personal
      endings directly: amārem, monērem, dūcerem, audīrem. The mnemonic
      is simple: "infinitive + personal endings." The imperfect
      subjunctive appears in secondary sequence purpose and result clauses,
      in contrary-to-fact conditions in present time (sī habērem, darēm —
      "if I had, I would give"), and in various other subordinate clauses
      governed by a past main verb.

    description: >
      The present active infinitive is the second principal part of a Latin
      verb and the form by which conjugation class is most easily
      identified. The endings are: 1st conjugation -āre (amāre), 2nd
      conjugation -ēre (monēre), 3rd conjugation -ere (dūcere, with short
      e), 4th conjugation -īre (audīre). The infinitive functions as a
      verbal noun: it can serve as subject or object of another verb and
      is essential for indirect statement (accusative + infinitive
      construction). Distinguishing 2nd conjugation -ēre (long ē) from
      3rd conjugation -ere (short e) is critical.

      The perfect active infinitive expresses a completed action in
      indirect statement and other infinitive constructions. It is formed
      by adding -isse to the perfect stem: amāvisse, monuisse, dūxisse,
      audīvisse. In practice, syncopated (contracted) forms are very
      common: amāsse (for amāvisse), dūxe (rare, but dīxe for dīxisse
      is attested). The perfect infinitive is essential for indirect
      statement when the action of the infinitive is prior to the main
      verb: dīcit eum vēnisse means "he says that he (has) came."

      The present participle is a verbal adjective expressing ongoing
      action simultaneous with the main verb. It is formed by adding
      -ns (nominative singular) to the present stem, with the genitive
      in -ntis. It declines like a third-declension i-stem adjective
      (ablative singular normally -ī when used as a pure adjective, -e
      when used as a circumstantial participle). The forms by conjugation
      are: 1st amāns, amantis; 2nd monēns, monentis; 3rd dūcēns,
      dūcentis; 4th audiēns, audientis. The present participle of sum

      The perfect passive participle (PPP) is the fourth principal part

      passive action. It declines exactly like a first-and-second-
      declension adjective (bonus, -a, -um pattern): masculine -us,
      feminine -a, neuter -um. The PPP is used to form all perfect
      passive tenses (with sum, eram, erō) and the ablative absolute
      construction. Common formations include: amātus (loved), monitus
      (warned), ductus (led), audītus (heard). The PPP is one of the
