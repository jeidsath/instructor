  - name: "Nominative Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 1
    prerequisites: []
    description: >
      The nominative is the case of the subject and the predicate nominative.
      Every finite verb in Latin agrees with a nominative subject in person
      and number. A predicate nominative (also called predicate noun or
      predicate adjective) appears with linking verbs such as sum, fīō, and
      passive forms of verbs like appellō and creō, where it renames or
      describes the subject and therefore takes the same case.
    examples:
      - latin: "Puella cantat."
        english: "The girl sings."
        notes: >
          Puella is nominative singular, serving as the subject of cantat.
      - latin: "Marcus est agricola."
        english: "Marcus is a farmer."
        notes: >
          Both Marcus (subject) and agricola (predicate nominative) are in
          the nominative case. The predicate nominative renames the subject
          after the linking verb est.
      - latin: "Rēgīna sapiens est."
        english: "The queen is wise."
        notes: >
          Sapiens is a predicate adjective in the nominative, describing
          the subject rēgīna after the linking verb.

  - name: "Accusative Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 2
    prerequisites: ["Nominative Case"]
    description: >
      The accusative case has several functions. Its primary use is to mark the
      direct object of a transitive verb. It also expresses extent of time
      (duration) and extent of space (distance), and serves as the object of
      many prepositions (ad, in when indicating motion toward, per, trāns,
      inter, etc.). In addition, the accusative appears in exclamations and
      in the accusative-plus-infinitive construction of indirect statement.
    examples:
      - latin: "Agricola agrum arat."
        english: "The farmer plows the field."
        notes: >
          Agrum is accusative singular, functioning as the direct object of
          the transitive verb arat.
      - latin: "Multōs annōs vīxit."
        english: "He lived for many years."
        notes: >
          Multōs annōs is an accusative of extent of time, expressing
          duration without a preposition.
      - latin: "Ad urbem ambulāvit."
        english: "He walked to the city."
        notes: >
          Urbem is accusative after the preposition ad, indicating motion
          toward.
      - latin: "Per silvam iter fēcimus."
        english: "We made a journey through the forest."
        notes: >
          Silvam is accusative after per. Many prepositions of motion or
          extent take the accusative.

  - name: "Genitive Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Accusative Case"]
    description: >
      The genitive case broadly expresses a relationship between two nouns,
      most commonly possession. It also serves in the partitive genitive
      (indicating the whole of which a part is taken), the objective genitive
      (the object of the action implied by the noun), the subjective genitive
      (the agent of the action implied by the noun), the genitive of
      description (quality or characteristic), and with certain adjectives
      and verbs that take a genitive complement. The genitive often
      corresponds to English 'of' or the possessive.
    examples:
      - latin: "Domus patris magna est."
        english: "The father's house is large."
        notes: >
          Patris is a possessive genitive modifying domus.
      - latin: "Pars mīlitum fūgit."
        english: "Part of the soldiers fled."
        notes: >
          Mīlitum is a partitive genitive, indicating the whole from which
          pars is drawn.
      - latin: "Amor patriae eum impulit."
        english: "Love of the fatherland drove him."
        notes: >
          Patriae can be read as an objective genitive (love directed toward
          the fatherland) or a subjective genitive depending on context.
          Here the objective reading is more natural.
      - latin: "Vir magnae virtūtis erat."
        english: "He was a man of great courage."
        notes: >
          Magnae virtūtis is a genitive of description (quality), modifying
          vir.

  - name: "Dative Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Accusative Case"]
    description: >
      The dative case marks the indirect object, the person or thing
      indirectly affected by the action. Beyond this core use, Latin employs
      the dative of reference (the person concerned or affected), the dative
      of possession (with esse to express ownership), the dative of purpose
      (or double dative, where a dative of purpose combines with a dative of
      reference), and the dative with special intransitive verbs such as
      crēdō, noceō, pāreō, persuādeō, and placeō, which take a dative
      complement rather than an accusative direct object.
    examples:
      - latin: "Magister discipulīs librōs dat."
        english: "The teacher gives books to the students."
        notes: >
          Discipulīs is a dative of indirect object, indicating the
          recipients of the giving.
      - latin: "Mihi est liber."
        english: "I have a book (literally, 'There is a book for me')."
        notes: >
          Mihi is a dative of possession. Latin uses the dative with esse
          to express possession, rather than a verb meaning 'to have.'
      - latin: "Hoc nōbīs auxiliō fuit."
        english: "This was a help to us."
        notes: >
          This is a double dative construction: auxiliō is the dative of
          purpose (for the purpose of help) and nōbīs is the dative of
          reference (for us).
      - latin: "Tibi crēdō."
        english: "I believe you."
        notes: >
          Crēdō takes a dative complement (tibi), not an accusative. This
          is one of several Latin verbs with dative objects that correspond
          to transitive English verbs.

  - name: "Ablative Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 4
    prerequisites: ["Dative Case"]
    description: >
      The ablative is the most versatile Latin case, absorbing the functions
      of several Proto-Indo-European cases. Its major uses include: ablative
      of means or instrument (the tool or means by which something is done,
      no preposition), ablative of accompaniment (cum + ablative), ablative
      of manner (cum + ablative, or without cum if an adjective is present),
      ablative of time when (point in time, no preposition), ablative of
      agent (ā/ab + ablative, with passive verbs), ablative of separation
      (from, away from), ablative of place where (in + ablative), and
      ablative absolute (a participial phrase grammatically independent of
      the main clause).
    examples:
      - latin: "Gladiō pugnāvit."
        english: "He fought with a sword."
        notes: >
          Gladiō is an ablative of means/instrument. No preposition is used
          for the instrument in Latin.
      - latin: "Cum amīcīs ambulat."
        english: "She walks with friends."
        notes: >
          Amīcīs is an ablative of accompaniment with the preposition cum.
      - latin: "Prīmā lūce profectī sunt."
        english: "They set out at first light."

          point in time without a preposition.
      - latin: "Liber ā discipulō legitur."
        english: "The book is read by the student."
        notes: >
          Ā discipulō is an ablative of agent with the preposition ā/ab,
          used with passive verbs to indicate the person performing the
          action.
      - latin: "Urbe discessit."
        english: "He departed from the city."
        notes: >
          Urbe is an ablative of separation. With names of cities, towns,
          and small islands, no preposition is needed for place from which.

  - name: "Vocative Case"
    subcategory: case_usage
    difficulty: 1
    prerequisites: []
    description: >
      The vocative case is used for direct address. In almost all declensions,
      its forms are identical to the nominative. The one notable exception is
      second-declension masculine nouns in -us, which form the vocative
      singular in -e (e.g., Marcus becomes Marce), and nouns in -ius, which
      contract to -ī (e.g., fīlius becomes fīlī). The vocative is typically
      set off by commas and often accompanied by the interjection ō.
    examples:
      - latin: "Marce, venī hūc!"
        english: "Marcus, come here!"
        notes: >
          Marce is the vocative singular of Marcus, showing the -e ending
          characteristic of second-declension -us nouns.
      - latin: "Ō amīcī, audīte mē!"
        english: "O friends, listen to me!"
        notes: >
          Amīcī is the vocative plural, identical to the nominative plural
          for second-declension nouns. The interjection ō often accompanies
          the vocative.
      - latin: "Quid agis, puella?"
        english: "What are you doing, girl?"
        notes: >
          Puella is vocative singular, identical in form to the nominative
          for first-declension nouns.
