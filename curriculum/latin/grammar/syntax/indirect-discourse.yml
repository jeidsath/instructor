      Latin expresses indirect statement (reported speech after verbs of
      saying, thinking, knowing, perceiving) not with a 'that' clause as in
      English, but with an accusative subject and an infinitive verb. The
      subject of the reported statement goes into the accusative case, and
      the verb becomes an infinitive. The tense of the infinitive is relative
      to the main verb: the present infinitive indicates action at the same
      time as the main verb, the perfect infinitive indicates action before
      the main verb, and the future infinitive indicates action after the
      main verb. This construction is one of the most distinctive features of
      Latin syntax.
    examples:
      - latin: "Dīcit puellam cantāre."
        english: "He says that the girl is singing."
        notes: >
          Puellam is accusative (subject of the indirect statement) and
          cantare is the present active infinitive, indicating action
          simultaneous with the main verb dicit.
      - latin: "Dīxit puellam cantāvisse."
        english: "He said that the girl had sung."
        notes: >
          Cantavisse is the perfect active infinitive, indicating the
          singing occurred before the time of the main verb dixit.
      - latin: "Dīcit puellam cantātūram esse."
        english: "He says that the girl will sing."
        notes: >
          Cantaturam esse is the future active infinitive (future active
          participle + esse), indicating action subsequent to the main verb.
      - latin: "Crēdō tē bonum virum esse."
        english: "I believe that you are a good man."
        notes: >
          Te is the accusative subject. Bonum virum is a predicate
          accusative, agreeing with the subject of the infinitive. The
          present infinitive esse indicates time simultaneous with credo.
      - latin: "Scīmus urbem captam esse."
        english: "We know that the city was captured."
        notes: >
          Captam esse is the perfect passive infinitive (perfect passive
          participle + esse). Urbem is the accusative subject, and captam
          agrees with it.

  - name: "Indirect Question"
    subcategory: indirect_discourse
    difficulty: 8
    prerequisites: ["Indirect Statement", "Interrogative Pronoun"]
    description: >
      Indirect questions are subordinate clauses that report a question after
      verbs of asking, knowing, telling, wondering, and similar expressions.
      Unlike indirect statements, which use the accusative-infinitive
      construction, indirect questions use a subordinate clause with the verb
      in the subjunctive. They are introduced by interrogative words such as
      quis, quid, cur, ubi, quomodo, num, utrum...an, and -ne. The tense of
      the subjunctive follows the sequence of tenses: in primary sequence
      (main verb in present or future), the present subjunctive expresses
      simultaneous action and the perfect subjunctive expresses prior action;
      in secondary sequence (main verb in a past tense), the imperfect
      subjunctive expresses simultaneous action and the pluperfect subjunctive
      expresses prior action.
    examples:
      - latin: "Rogat quid faciās."
        english: "He asks what you are doing."
        notes: >
          Primary sequence: the main verb rogat is present, so the
          simultaneous action in the indirect question uses the present
          subjunctive facias.
      - latin: "Rogāvit quid facerēs."
        english: "He asked what you were doing."
        notes: >
          Secondary sequence: the main verb rogavit is perfect (past), so
          simultaneous action uses the imperfect subjunctive faceres.
      - latin: "Nesciō ubi sit."
        english: "I do not know where he is."
        notes: >
          Nescio introduces the indirect question; ubi is the interrogative
          adverb; sit is present subjunctive in primary sequence.
      - latin: "Quaesīvit num venīssēs."
        english: "He asked whether you had come."
        notes: >
          Num introduces a yes/no indirect question. Venisses is pluperfect
          subjunctive in secondary sequence, indicating action prior to the
          main verb quaesivit.
      - latin: "Incertum est utrum maneat an proficīscātur."
        english: "It is uncertain whether he is staying or departing."
        notes: >
          Utrum...an introduces an alternative indirect question.
          Present subjunctives maneat and proficiscatur follow the primary
          main expression incertum est.

  - name: "Indirect Command"
    subcategory: indirect_discourse
    difficulty: 8
    prerequisites: ["Indirect Question", "Purpose Clauses"]
    description: >
      Indirect commands (also called jussive noun clauses) report orders,
      requests, advice, or persuasion. They are introduced by ut (affirmative)
      or ne (negative) with the subjunctive, following verbs such as imperō
      ('I order'), rogō ('I ask'), moneō ('I advise'), hortor ('I urge'),
      persuādeō ('I persuade'), and petō ('I seek, request'). The tense of
      the subjunctive follows the regular sequence of tenses: present
      subjunctive after a primary main verb, imperfect subjunctive after a
      secondary main verb. This construction is syntactically similar to
      purpose clauses but is classified separately because it fills the role
      of a noun clause (object of the main verb) rather than an adverbial
      clause of purpose.
    examples:
      - latin: "Imperāvit ut mīlitēs proficīscerentur."
        english: "He ordered the soldiers to set out."
        notes: >
          Imperavit (secondary) is followed by ut + imperfect subjunctive
          (proficiscerentur). The subject of the indirect command (milites)
          appears in the nominative within the ut clause.
      - latin: "Tē rogō nē discēdās."
        english: "I ask you not to leave."
        notes: >
          Rogo (primary) is followed by ne + present subjunctive (discedas)
          for a negative indirect command.
      - latin: "Monet ut caveāmus."
        english: "He advises us to be careful."
        notes: >
          Monet (primary) with ut + present subjunctive (caveamus). The
          subject of the subjunctive clause (implied nos) is the same as
          the indirect object of the main verb.
      - latin: "Persuāsit eī ut venīret."
        english: "He persuaded him to come."
        notes: >
          Persuadeo takes a dative object (ei) and is followed by ut +
          imperfect subjunctive (veniret) in secondary sequence.
      - latin: "Petīvit nē id facerent."
        english: "He asked that they not do this."
        notes: >
          Petivit (secondary) with ne + imperfect subjunctive (facerent).
          Ne is used for negative commands, never ut non.
