  - name: "Purpose Clauses"
    subcategory: subordinate_clauses
    difficulty: 7
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Subjunctive"]
    description: >
      Purpose clauses express the intention or goal of the action in the main
      clause. The standard construction uses ut ('in order that') with the
      subjunctive for affirmative purpose and ne ('in order that ... not, lest')
      with the subjunctive for negative purpose. The tense of the subjunctive
      follows the sequence of tenses: present subjunctive after a primary main
      verb, imperfect subjunctive after a secondary (past) main verb. Latin
      can also express purpose through a relative clause of purpose, where
      the relative pronoun qui/quae/quod replaces ut and is followed by the
      subjunctive.
    examples:
      - latin: "Venit ut urbem videat."
        english: "He comes in order to see the city."
        notes: >
          Ut + present subjunctive (videat) after a primary tense main verb
          (venit). This is the standard affirmative purpose clause.
      - latin: "Fugit ne caperetur."
        english: "He fled lest he be captured."
        notes: >
          Ne + imperfect subjunctive (caperetur) after a secondary tense
          main verb (fugit). Negative purpose uses ne, never ut non.
      - latin: "Mīlitēs mīsit quī pontem dēlērent."
        english: "He sent soldiers to destroy the bridge."
        notes: >
          A relative clause of purpose: qui + imperfect subjunctive
          (delerent). The relative pronoun replaces ut and refers to
          milites.
      - latin: "Venimus nē quid malī accideret."
        english: "We came so that nothing bad might happen."
        notes: >
          Ne quid is the negative purpose construction with the indefinite
          quid. The imperfect subjunctive accideret follows a secondary
          main verb.

  - name: "Result Clauses"
    subcategory: subordinate_clauses
    difficulty: 7
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Subjunctive"]
    description: >
      Result clauses (also called consecutive clauses) express the actual or
      natural consequence of the action or quality described in the main
      clause. They are introduced by ut (affirmative) or ut non (negative)
      with the subjunctive. Result clauses are typically signaled by a word
      in the main clause indicating degree: tam ('so'), tantus ('so great'),
      ita or sic ('so, in such a way'), tot ('so many'), talis ('of such a
      kind'), or adeo ('to such a degree'). Unlike purpose clauses, result
      clauses negate with ut non (not ne), and the tense of the subjunctive
      is not strictly bound by sequence of tenses but tends to reflect the
      actual time of the result.
    examples:
      - latin: "Tam fortis erat ut omnēs eum laudārent."
        english: "He was so brave that everyone praised him."
        notes: >
          The signal word tam in the main clause triggers the result clause
          ut + subjunctive (laudarent). The imperfect subjunctive reflects
          past time.
      - latin: "Tanta tempestās coorta est ut nāvēs cursum tenēre nōn possent."
        english: "So great a storm arose that the ships could not hold their course."
        notes: >
          Tanta signals the result clause. Note ut non possent for negative
          result, not ne.
      - latin: "Ita vīxit ut ab omnibus amārētur."
        english: "He lived in such a way that he was loved by all."
        notes: >
          Ita in the main clause signals the result. The imperfect passive
          subjunctive amaretur expresses the consequence.
      - latin: "Adeo stultus est ut nihil intellegat."
        english: "He is so foolish that he understands nothing."
        notes: >
          Adeo signals degree. Present subjunctive intellegat after a
          primary main verb. Negative element nihil appears within the
          ut clause, not as ne.

  - name: "Temporal Clauses"
    subcategory: subordinate_clauses
    difficulty: 6
    prerequisites: ["Imperfect Active Subjunctive"]
    description: >
      Temporal clauses specify the time relationship between the subordinate
      event and the main clause. The conjunction cum ('when') has two distinct
      constructions: cum with the indicative states a definite or specific
      time, while cum with the subjunctive (often called 'circumstantial cum')
      expresses attendant circumstances and can shade into causal ('since') or
      concessive ('although') meaning. Other temporal conjunctions include
      postquam ('after,' typically with the perfect indicative), antequam and
      priusquam ('before,' with indicative for fact or subjunctive for
      anticipation/prevention), and dum ('while' with present indicative for
      simultaneous action, or 'until' with subjunctive for anticipated
      action).
    examples:
      - latin: "Cum Caesar vēnit, hostēs fūgērunt."
        english: "When Caesar arrived, the enemy fled."
        notes: >
          Cum + perfect indicative (venit) states a definite temporal fact.
          This is temporal cum with indicative.
      - latin: "Cum mīlitēs fortiter pugnārent, hostēs tamen vīcērunt."
        english: "Although the soldiers were fighting bravely, the enemy nevertheless won."
        notes: >
          Cum + imperfect subjunctive (pugnarent) with tamen indicates
          circumstantial cum with a concessive nuance.
      - latin: "Postquam id audīvit, profectus est."
        english: "After he heard this, he set out."
        notes: >
          Postquam typically takes the perfect indicative (audivit) to
          indicate a completed action.
      - latin: "Dum haec geruntur, Caesar certior factus est."
        english: "While these things were going on, Caesar was informed."
        notes: >
          Dum meaning 'while' takes the present indicative (geruntur) even
          in past narrative. This is a fixed idiom.
      - latin: "Exspectāvit dum cōpiae convenīrent."
        english: "He waited until the troops assembled."
        notes: >
          Dum meaning 'until' with an anticipated action takes the
          subjunctive (convenirent).

  - name: "Causal Clauses"
    subcategory: subordinate_clauses
    difficulty: 6
    prerequisites: ["Temporal Clauses"]
    description: >
      Causal clauses give the reason for the action in the main clause. The
      conjunctions quod and quia ('because') take the indicative when the
      author presents the reason as an objective fact, but the subjunctive when
      the reason is attributed to someone else or presented as alleged rather
      than confirmed. The conjunction cum ('since') with the subjunctive is
      frequently used to express cause as part of the attendant circumstances.
      Quoniam ('since, seeing that') generally takes the indicative and
      presents the cause as an accepted fact.
    examples:
      - latin: "Laetus est quod amīcum videt."
        english: "He is happy because he sees his friend."
        notes: >
          Quod + indicative (videt) states the cause as an objective fact
          affirmed by the author.
      - latin: "Eum laudāvērunt quod fortis esset."
        english: "They praised him because (as they said) he was brave."
        notes: >
          Quod + subjunctive (esset) signals that the reason is reported
          or alleged, not directly asserted by the author.
      - latin: "Cum hoc vērum sit, discēdāmus."
        english: "Since this is true, let us depart."
        notes: >
          Cum + subjunctive (sit) expresses cause as part of the
          circumstances. This causal cum is common in Latin prose.
      - latin: "Quoniam id ita est, proficīscere."
        english: "Since that is so, depart."
        notes: >
          Quoniam + indicative (est) presents the cause as an established
          and accepted fact.

  - name: "Conditional Clauses"
    subcategory: subordinate_clauses
    difficulty: 7
    prerequisites: ["Present Active Subjunctive", "Imperfect Active Subjunctive"]
    description: >
      Conditional sentences consist of a protasis (the 'if' clause introduced
      by si or nisi/ni) and an apodosis (the main clause stating the
      consequence). Latin conditionals fall into several types based on the
      mood and tense of the verbs. Simple or factual conditions use the
      indicative in both clauses (si hoc facit, errat - 'if he does this, he
      is wrong'). Future more vivid conditions use the future or future
      perfect indicative. Future less vivid conditions (should/would) use
      the present subjunctive in both clauses. Present contrary-to-fact
      conditions use the imperfect subjunctive in both clauses. Past
      contrary-to-fact conditions use the pluperfect subjunctive in both
      clauses.
    examples:
      - latin: "Si hoc dīcis, errās."
        english: "If you say this, you are wrong."
        notes: >
          A simple (factual) present condition. Both clauses use the
          present indicative. No judgment is made about the likelihood
          of the condition.
      - latin: "Si hoc dīcās, errēs."
        english: "If you should say this, you would be wrong."
        notes: >
          A future less vivid condition. Both clauses use the present
          subjunctive (dicas, erres). The condition is presented as
          hypothetical or less likely.
      - latin: "Si hoc dīcerēs, errārēs."
        english: "If you were saying this, you would be wrong."
        notes: >
          A present contrary-to-fact condition. Both clauses use the
          imperfect subjunctive (diceres, errares). The implication is
          that the condition is not actually true now.
      - latin: "Si hoc dīxissēs, errāvissēs."
        english: "If you had said this, you would have been wrong."
        notes: >
          A past contrary-to-fact condition. Both clauses use the
          pluperfect subjunctive (dixisses, erravisses). The condition
          was not fulfilled in the past.
      - latin: "Nisi mē adiuvissēs, periissem."
        english: "If you had not helped me, I would have perished."
        notes: >
          Nisi ('if not, unless') introduces a negative condition. This
          is past contrary-to-fact: the help did occur, so the perishing
          did not.
