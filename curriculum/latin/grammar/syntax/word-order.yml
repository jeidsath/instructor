      Latin word order is considerably freer than English because grammatical
      relationships are signaled primarily by inflectional endings rather than
      position. Nevertheless, the default or unmarked word order is
      Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), with the finite verb tending to appear at the
      end of its clause. New or emphasized information often moves to the
      beginning of the sentence (topic position) or just before the verb
      (focus position). Connectives, subordinating conjunctions, and
      prepositions naturally precede their complements. In practice, authors
      vary word order freely for rhetorical emphasis, rhythm, and style, but
      understanding the SOV baseline is essential for parsing.
    examples:
      - latin: "Agricola agrum arat."
        english: "The farmer plows the field."
        notes: >
          This sentence follows the default SOV order: subject (agricola),
          direct object (agrum), verb (arat).
      - latin: "Puella rosam amat."
        english: "The girl loves the rose."
        notes: >
          Another straightforward SOV sentence. Even if reordered to
          'Rosam puella amat,' the meaning stays the same because the case
          endings, not word position, mark grammatical function.
      - latin: "Magnus est dolor."
        english: "Great is the grief."
        notes: >
          Here the predicate adjective magnus is fronted for emphasis,
          departing from the neutral order. The verb est also appears
          medially. Such variation is common and stylistically significant.
      - latin: "Vēnī, vīdī, vīcī."
        english: "I came, I saw, I conquered."
        notes: >
          Caesar's famous tricolon places verbs first for dramatic impact.
          This demonstrates that word order in Latin is a tool of rhetoric,
          not a rigid rule.

  - name: "Adjective Placement"
    subcategory: word_order
    difficulty: 3
    prerequisites: ["Basic Word Order", "First-Second Declension Adjectives"]
    description: >
      In Latin, adjectives may appear before or after the noun they modify,
      and their position carries stylistic and semantic weight. As a general
      pattern, adjectives of size, quantity, and demonstratives tend to
      precede the noun, while adjectives of quality, color, nationality, and
      distinguishing characteristics tend to follow it. An adjective placed
      in an unexpected position receives emphasis. In poetry, adjectives and
      their nouns are often widely separated (hyperbaton) for artistic effect.
      A predicate adjective stands apart from its noun, typically near the
      verb, and describes the subject through a linking verb.
    examples:
      - latin: "Magnus vir vēnit."
        english: "A great man came."
        notes: >
          Magnus precedes vir. Adjectives of size and importance commonly
          appear before their noun.
      - latin: "Via longa est."
        english: "The road is long."
        notes: >
          Longa is a predicate adjective, separated from via by the linking
          verb est. It describes the subject through the copula.
      - latin: "Puella Rōmāna cantat."
        english: "The Roman girl sings."
        notes: >
          Adjectives of nationality and distinguishing type typically follow
          the noun: Rōmāna after puella.
      - latin: "Multōs per annōs errāvit."
        english: "He wandered for many years."
        notes: >
          Multōs precedes its noun annōs, as adjectives of quantity normally
          do. Note that the preposition per is placed between the adjective
          and noun, a common Latin arrangement.
      - latin: "Magnā cum cūrā scrīpsit."
        english: "He wrote with great care."
        notes: >
          The adjective magnā is separated from its noun cūrā by the
          preposition cum. This interlocking word order is characteristic
          of Latin prose and especially poetry.
