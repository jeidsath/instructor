# Instructor

Greek and Latin language instruction system.

The learner is modelled internally by the system as a set of knowledge and capacities. The system evaluates and teaches the learner and practices with him in order to improve the various language capacities. Eventual goal: the capacity to understand and produce written and spoken Greek and Latin.

Greek and Latin should be taught and evaluated separately, not together.
